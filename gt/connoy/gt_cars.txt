+---------+
This document is simply a list of all 172 (148 distinct) cars available in
the North American version of Gran Turismo.  I've decided to compile it
because despite a good chunk of literature on tuning and racing technique
associated with the game, no complete and accurate list of the cars and their
capabilities has been assembled.  So, here it is.  Because of its tabular
nature, this document requires a monospace font and five-character tabs--be
sure the following characters line up.

Version 1.5: 17 Feb 1999.  "Gran Turismo's Best Cars" no longer known as a
     "Super Special Bonus Section" as it's gotten so big now.  Added "Best
     Arcade Mode Cars" to "Gran Turismo's Best Cars".  Added cheapo ASCII
     boxes to section headings.  Overall ratings added to Chevrolet, Dodge,
     Aston Martin, and TVR cars.  Changed number of gears for each car to the
     "Normal" number (instead of the "Racing Support" number), and verified
     each one.  Reorganized the "Introduction/Notation" section to make it
     a bit more readable.  Other miscellaneous changes here and there.
Version 1.6: 14 April 1999.  Made major revisions to diversify the "Best
     Normal Cars" and "Best FF Cars" lists.  Added overall ratings to Honda
     and Mitsubishi cars.  Cut the "Version History" down to the last two
     versions.  Added "Prize Car Listing" for a quick reference to the prize
     cars.

+-----------------------+
| Introduction/Notation |
+-----------------------+
Name: The first column contains the car's name, prefixed with a "*" if it is
a prize car (obtained by winning a particular event) and/or an [R] if it is a
racing-spec car.

DrvTrn: This column notes the car's drivetrain (using the conventions in the
Gran Turismo manual).

#G: The next column is the number of gears in car's transmission when fitted
with its normal gearbox.  All 4-speed cars and some 5-speed cars get an extra
gear when fitted with the "Racing Support" gearbox.

Stock HP: Listed with each car is the stock peak horsepower (this is the real
value from the garage, NOT the figure quoted by the dealership).

Tuned HP: This is the peak HP after all highest-spec parts installed.

Stock Wt.: This is the unmodified weight of the car.

Tuned Wt.: The car's weight after all three stages of weight reduction.

Racing Wt.: The car's weight with racing modification fitted.

Rating: Under the "Rating" column, I'll give a general rating of the car's
race-winning potential when fully tuned.  Ratings from lowest to highest are
Poor, Fair, Good, Great.

I'll also note which race awards a particular prize car, its commonality, and
what colors it comes in; many cars will have miscellaneous comments after
their entry describing their rating or other unique characteristics.  I have
labeled a few things "BUG" or "Mysterious Fact"; if you find anything that's
similar in nature to them, please let me know.  The "distinct" number of cars
under each dealer's name is the total after removing cars with identical
statistics (it's kind of silly to count the 3 identical Eunos Roadsters as 3
different cars).

     The '95 Primera has a better suspension than its older brother, which
     lets it take corners quite a bit faster.

R32 Skyline GTS-4                 4WD 5 208   333   3130  2660  2253   Poor
     The GTS Type M and Type S have better acceleration than their peak HP   
     indicates, due to their more gently sloped power curves.  The GTS-4 has
     the worst power-to-weight ratio in a tuned 4WD, and is the least
     powerful 4WD overall.

Fairlady Z TwinTurbo 2by2         FR  5 272   670   3461  2940  2491   Fair
Fairlady Z TwinTurbo 2seater      FR  5 272   670   3373  2865  2427   Fair
     Sadly, the engine redlines (and thus the transmission shifts) far too
     early on the turbo Zs to fully take advantage of the meaty powerband
     *after* the 670 HP peak.  Otherwise they might have earned Good.

Pulsar '91 GTi-R                  4WD 5 222   381   2689  2286  1935   Fair
     Lightest commercially available four-wheel drive car.             

R32 Skyline '89 GT-R              4WD 5 303   913   3152  2678  2268   Great
     Best power-to-weight ratio in a tuned car!
R32 Skyline '91 GT-R              4WD 5 303   913   3262  2773  2347   Great
*R32 Skyline '91 GT-R             4WD 5 303   913   3262  2773  2347   Great
     Rare award in Hard-Tuned Car event; red, yellow, or blue.
R32 Skyline GT-R Vspec            4WD 5 303   913   3306  2810  2380   Great
R32 Skyline GT-R Vspec II         4WD 5 303   854   3306  2810  2380   Great
R32 Skyline GT-R Nismo            4WD 5 303   854   3306  2810  2380   Great
     What is there to say?  The Skyline GT-Rs are all absurdly powerful and
     light, and since they're 4WD, even a monkey could race them.

R33 Skyline '95 GT-R              4WD 5 310   937   3373  2865  2427   Great
R33 Skyline GT-R                  4WD 5 310   937   3373  2865  2427   Great
R33 Skyline '95 GT-R Vspec        4WD 5 310   937   3395  2885  2442   Great
R33 Skyline GT-R Vspec            4WD 5 310   941   3395  2885  2442   Great
     The Twinkiemobiles strike again!  The R33 GT-R Vspec is the most
     powerful car.

*Nismo GT-R LM                    FR  5 311   860   3483  2960  2506   Good
     Awarded in All-Night II event; silver.  Though it has brutal HP, its
     weight makes the Nismo GT-R a handful to drive on twisty courses.

*Nismo 400R                       4WD 5 411   860   3417  2903  2460   Great
     Awarded in IA License test; silver, gray, red, or yellow. Most power and
     best power-to-weight ratio in a stock 4WD.  Demolishes the Normal event.

[R]Nismo GT-R LM                  FR  6       653               2513   Great
     
*[R]S14 Silvia LM Edition         FR  6       536               2116   Great
     Awarded in All-Night I event; red or ectoplasm green.  Least powerful
     racing-spec car.

     The problem of the older NSXs' relatively weaker power-to-weight ratio
     is compounded by their 5-speed transmission.

| Gran Turismo's Best Cars |
+--------------------------+
I added this section to help fill out where this list is lacking; it contains
a few more subjective lists that I hope you'll find useful.  I like these
more because they let me inject color commentary. :) :) :)


Best Bargain Cars
=================
First, the "bargain" cars.  When you first start Simulation Mode, you only
have 10,000 credits to your name, and amongst the various dealers' used car
lots, about twenty different cars to choose from with which to start your
career in the Sunday Cup.  Here are my top picks from the El Cheapo
department.

7. Mitsubishi GTO '92
     This car makes the list because it's one of only two bargain-priced 4WD
     cars.  The other cheap 4WD is the R32 Skyline GTS-4, which is a better
     car in stock form, but I have to give the nod to the GTO for better
     expandability (it can get as high as 381 HP).  Only buy this car if
     you're hellbent on starting out with a 4WD, and do it right away--a
     cheap '92 GTO is only available for the first 9 career days.  And for
     god's sake, spend your remaining cash on weight reduction! :)
6. Mazda FC Savanna RX-7 GT-X
     This RX-7 has a good mix of power and weight for a starting car.  It has
     better expandability than the front-wheel drive cars on this list, but
     still not as much as the Supra or Silvia.  No bells and whistles, just a
     decent turbo-engined FR car.
5. Mitsubishi Mirage '92 Cyborg R
     The Mirage Cyborg R is a fairly good FF car with straightforward
     handling.  It's neither hugely powerful nor very upgradeable, but it's
     capable of winning the Sunday Cup with no modification and is eligible
     for the Lightweight Battle down the road.
4. Toyota MA70 Supra GT Turbo Limited
     This is the most powerful ride you'll find for under 10K beans.  It's
     also expandable to a whopping 585 HP!  However, since it is rear-wheel
     drive and badly in need of some time on the Jenny Craig program, it's a
     bit tough to handle.  Avoid this car if you're inexperienced, or it'll
     be, in the words of one Usenet reader, "time to make the donuts!"
3. Honda Prelude '94 VTEC
     The '94 Prelude is a superbly powerful, easy to handle front-wheel drive
     car.  If a heavy chassis doesn't bother you as long as you've got muscle
     under the hood, then this Prelude is for you.  Though not a turbo, it
     can still be tuned up to a healthy 377 HP, which is very high for an FF.
2. Nissan S13 Silvia '88 K's 1800cc
     Though nothing special in stock form, this car has great expandability
     (492 HP fully tuned) which, combined with its light(er) weight, makes it
     a great value for your money.  Not only that, but its purchase price is
     so low, you can spend your remaining cash on some upgrades right away!
1. Honda Civic '93 3Door Si
     This is without a doubt the all-around best front-wheel drive car you
     can afford with your starting cash.  Its power may be nothing special,
     but its light weight makes it very speedy and nimble.  This car is also
     eligible (and awesome) for the Lightweight Battle.


Best Front-Wheel Drive Cars
===========================
Unfortunately, no front-wheel drive car in the big list earned even a "Good"
rating.  The front-wheel drive cars simply don't have the potential of the
other drivetrains, and because they get such a shaft when compared with other
cars, here's a rundown of the most effective FF cars.  The Civic, Integra,
and FTO are best bets in the Lightweight event as well.

7. Honda Civic '93 3Door Si
     Mentioned above as a good car to start with, this Civic just keeps on
     going and going.  Upgraded to racing-spec parts and turbo aspiration, it
     can embarrass the Vipers and NSXs in the Sunday Cup easily.  Don't use
     racing modification on this car unless you like to tip over.
6. Nissan Primera '95 2.0Te
     Nissan's only FF car is a solid one, with consistent handling and very
     good power delivery.  The '90 version is okay at best, because its
     handling is a little too slippery.
5. Mitsubishi Eclipse GT
     A big ol' turbo engine makes this the most powerful front-wheel drive
     car.  Unfortunately, it also has a big ol' butt, so its cornering 
     ability is not too spectacular.
4 & 3. Honda Prelude & Prelude '94 VTEC
     As powerful as the turbocharged Eclipse but lighter when fully tuned.
     I hate to include the current-model Preludes in here as I think they're
     butt-ugly, but they're as good as the older ones in tuned performance.
2. Acura Integra Type R
     In addition to its excellent power (for a front-wheel drive) and light
     weight, the Integra has amazingly responsive steering.  Unlike most FFs,
     it doesn't need a tap on the brakes at corner entry to avoid understeer.
1. Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R
     Though they suffer from more understeer than the Integra, in the end the
     higher power and lighter weight of the FTOs gives them the advantage.
     The GP Version R is the best of the many FTO sub-models, though they're
     all quite good.

Best Normal Cars
================
Since the ratings in this list reflect the cars' potential when fully tuned,
I feel it necessary to give some recognition to the cars that most excel with
no tuning.  These are, of course, the cars you'll want to go to for the
Normal Car event (and they're all capable of winning it even when the NSX is
around).

7. Subaru Impreza WRX-STi Type R
     This two-door version of the Impreza Sedan is not quite as nice as the
     prize version awarded by the Normal event, but it's still the best stock
     4WD car that you can buy in a store.
6. Subaru Impreza Sedan WRX-STi Ver.III
     This is the super-light prize version awarded by the Normal event.  Not
     as good as the Nismo 400R, but it's a lot easier to get.  Too bad you'll
     still have to win Normal (presumably with something else) to get one.
5. Acura NSX Type S Zero
     Fight fire with fire, they say (though RPG players use ice).  The NSX's
     mid-engine configuration can make it tricky to drive at first, but soon
     you'll find its well-distributed, light weight lets you catapult through
     corners without even bothering to brake.
4. TVR Griffith 500
     TVR's cute little roadster.  You probably hated the Griffith in the IA
     license tests, but the fact remains that the Griffith 500 has the best
     power-to-weight ratio of any normal car in the game--period.  Like the
     Cerbera, its handling is a little mushy, but practice makes perfect.
3. TVR Cerbera
     TVR's hardtop wonder stuffs a 343HP V8 into a tiny tiny 2500-pound body.
     Don't try to go all the way on the first date with the Cerbera--buy it
     some flowers, take it out for a few nice dinners.  Then it'll love you
     forever. :) :) :)
2. Nismo 400R
     Though it's absurdly difficult to obtain without a cheat, the Nismo 400R
     is the most bad-ass stock 4WD in the game.  It doesn't quite have the
     demonic acceleration of the Vipers, but its 4WD makes it easier to drive.
1. Dodge Viper RT/10
     The hellacious 440HP V10 makes this the best stock car in the game (it's
     a touch lighter than the GTS).  Though it's rear-wheel drive, it's quite
     easy to keep under control thanks to its mega-wide tires.  Awesome.


Best Arcade Mode Cars
=====================
GT's Arcade Mode is a neat little addition that's an excellent way to get
started with the game and handling cars of various drivetrains.  To release
the various bonus items, you have to win each race three times, with cars
>from  classes A, B, and C.  Some cars stand out above the rest within their
class:

7. Honda Civic '93 3Door Si
     Quite simply, this is the only Class C car you'll ever need.  It totally
     outshines the other cars in the class.
6. Mazda FC Savanna RX-7 Efini III
     Until the Toyota cars are released, this is your best bet for Class B.
     It doesn't have the high-end power of the Eclipse, though, so be sure to
     block on the straightaways.
5. Toyota Soarer 2.5GT-T VVT-i
     Probably the best Class B car.  A little harder to handle than the RX-7
     above, but Arcade Mode cars have such forgiving handling in general that
     this shouldn't be a problem.
4. Chevrolet Corvette '67 427 Coupe
     This Arcade Mode exclusive has nosebleed inducing acceleration compared
     to the imports, but it handles like a... how do you say?  Ah, yes--turd.
     The NSX is more nimble, and the Skyline more forgiving, but this is the
     fastest car that the initial selection has to offer.
3. Subaru Impreza '96 Sedan WRX-STi Version III
     The best 4-wheel drive car in Arcade Mode, the Impreza has very good
     acceleration and stupid good handling.
2. TVR Griffith 500
     A speedy car indeed, but the transition to Arcade Mode didn't seem to
     help the TVRs as much as it did the Viper--the Griffith and Cerbera
     still retain some of the quirks in their handling.
1. Dodge Viper GTS
     The Viper is absolutely heinous in Arcade Mode--as if the Simulation
     version didn't handle well enough considering its huge power delivery,
     the Arcade Mode version has even better grip characteristics.


Best Racing-Spec Cars
=====================
I kind of copped out and gave all the racing-spec cars (LMs and Special
Models) "Great" ratings.  Even the weakest racing-spec cars are a cut above
racing-modified stock cars because they have far better downforce, gearboxes,
and powerbands, but there are a half-dozen racing-spec cars that absolutely
stand out above the rest.  These are the best cars Gran Turismo has to offer,
and will allow you to win any race and look good doing it.

6. Subaru Impreza Rally Edition
     The Impreza has nearly flawless handling and is the better 4WD 500K
     Special Model available.  As its name implies, it smokes on the rally-
     style Special Stage R11 course, and is a perfect pick for the All-Night
     I event.  The trademark Subaru close gear ratios give it blistering
     acceleration at the cost of top speed, so be sure to lower the final
     gear ratio on tracks with straightaways and long sweeping bends.
5. Mazda RX-7 LM Edition
     This is the other 500K Special Model well worth investing in.  It's
     powerful, light, and extremely nimble, and being a saucy RX-7, it's a
     helluva lot more fun to drive than the "safer" 4WD cars.  The rush to be
     had from driving entire races *this close* to spinning out is something
     unmatched by the conservative handling of 4WD cars.
4. Mitsubishi FTO LM Edition
     Though racing US Vs. Japan repeatedly to get this car is time consuming,
     it is well worth the effort. The FTO LM Edition is a fabulous all-around
     racer that's absurdly easy to drive.  While it doesn't have the flat-out
     speed potential of the best rear-wheel drive LM cars, its forgiving
     handling and 4WD make it a great choice for the endurance races.
3. Honda del Sol LM Edition
     Why Honda picked the del Sol to make an LM out of, I have no idea.  But
     rejoice!  It is far and away the finest mid-engine car in Gran Turismo.
     The del Sol LM drifts so well that you can hurl it into turns without
     even hitting the brakes first.  Too bad it's so hard to obtain--you may
     have to race and win UK Vs. Japan many, many times before it comes up.
     (So many, in fact, that this car almost obtained "myth" status.:)
2. TVR Cerbera LM Edition
     The Cerbera's slutty older sister that you *can* go all the way with on
     the first date.  This car is just so damned good that I can't even find
     words for it.  It's the best alternative to the Concept Car if you're
     looking for a car you can race right out of the box, without having to
     fiddle with its setup, and still destroy everyone and everything.
1. Dodge Concept Car
     The greatest overall car in the game comes with one caveat: it can
     barely stay on the road under its default suspension settings.  It's
     necessary to put some time into tweaking this car's suspension and
     transmission settings before it can be truly competitive, but once it
     is--look out!  It can go from 0 to 200 and back in the blink of an eye,
     and in the words of Usenet reader Simon Palko, it "can corner like a
     bastard".  As good as it gets.

I hope everyone that reads this finds it a useful reference that helps them
enjoy Gran Turismo more (and spend less time buying and tuning cars just to
find out they suck).  For information on car tuning and settings, try Jet

list, but please try not to be too hostile if you feel your favorite/least
favorite car got shafted/praised by my rating system. :)
