[URL=urlurlurl]topic[/URL] at [URL]urlurlurl[/URL]

Someone there revealed that Thomas Nashe (1567-1601) wrote in <em>Have with you to Saffron-Walden</em> in 1596:

[QUOTE]"...O, tis a precious apothegmatical Pedant, who will finde matter inough to dilate a whole day of the first invention of Fy, fa fum, I smell the bloud of an English-man."[/QUOTE]

Adding that they were not trying to be rude to me, just that they thought the quote would be interesting.  Me, I'm insenstive enough that I often won't catch when people <em>are</em> being rude to me.  :)

He went on to cite <em>King Lear</em> III.IV Edgar's lines at the end of the scene are:

"...Childe Rowland to the dark tower came,
His word was still: Fie, foh, and fum,
I smell the blood of a British man"

adding that the lines --the play dates from about 1605--are a quotation from the
traditional story <em>Jack the Giant-Killer</em>.

I feel confident that "grind his bone to make my bread" dates to 1909 at the latest.  Detailed information about the history of its connection to the first two lines appear less clear, however.

As always, all the usual cautions with GameShark Codes apply.

Rationale:
  For a reasonably smooth course, you want stiff springs for better traction and response.  Stock was 5.4/5.6; multiplied by 3 (to keep the stock proportions) gave 16.2/16.8, I added a touch more at the rear to give slightly less oversteer.  Dampers were raised from 3 to 5 to match the stiffer springs.  Ride height was reduced.  But I find you can run into handling problems somewhere between 85 and 100 with many cars, so I don't usually go straight to the minimum.  I reduced the autoset until I was using all of top gear.  Hmm.  For a better driver that might cause him to run out on the main straight, I suppose.

  Since you and I drive grip (basically) I reduced the stabilizers from 4 to 3 since body roll is preferable to sliding with that style.  I left everything symmetric (dampers, stabilizers, ride height), since I don't have good intuition for when to do otherwise, and didn't have the time to experiment.  (I have difficulty doing very consistent lap times with the car, so it's difficult to distinguish change from experimental error).  With grip style the LSD initial and deceleration settings just seem to get in the way--sort of causing a binding sort of feel when you try to turn.  A highish acceleration setting helps when accelerating, though, and if you drop a tire into the dirt.  It might slow you down or cause loss of traction if you're really good at reacting with steering when accelerating on your exits, however.  That sounds like more of a drift style, though.  And, anyway, without LSD I find it's just way too easy to get one wheel spinning and then suddenly lose the whole rear end.  The LSD acceleration setting mostly prevents that.

Perhaps this will at least be a good reference point for other people's settings, since I've not made a lot of severe changes.

A nice car.  Really easy to win the SSR5 All-night with for practice, and also the All-Stars SSR5 race.  But it's not a total walk-over--not like using a Toyota GT-ONE.  Though in two races in the All-Stars I came back to win after spinning out, which means the car is well ahead of the worst lap times the AI will tolerate.  It's not a bad car to recommend for the GT300--it's in command without obliterating the competition (in my hands, at least).  Good players (better than me) could probably win all major races with this car.

I am almost finished a <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> game starting with the Fiji Blue Mitsubishi GTO'92.  While stipulating to myself that I should sell no cars (this makes it harder to afford the necessary modifications), I wanted to buy only one additional car--an entry for the Normal Series, and still complete the game (get all gold cups) in just 100 days.

The key to my strategy was using the prise <b>Demio</b> to win the FF, then the LightWeight, and then the Clubman.  I won one pole in the Sunday Cup with the GTO'92,

So I made the following mods to the Demio
[*]TS2, Rmuff, WR1, S/S sports tires  (Cr25,200)

It was upsetting having to waste the Cr7,000 on the sports tires which I would later upgrade, but it seemed a reasonably efficient strategy.  (If I had won less money, I would have used H/H sports tires, but if I do that then I, personally, have a good chance of coming second in the Grand Valley East race of the FF series--costing me Cr3,000).

I won the <b>FF</b> Series that way.  I got no poles, but won all races, so that was Cr25,000 winings.

Then I did:
[*]WR2, S/S racing tires (Cr20,500)

That allowed me to win all races in the <b>LightWeight</b> series (no poles, Cr25,000).

I won all races in the Clubman, (after a break to get my <b>A license</b> :) ) but got no poles and that was <b>Cr41,000</b> more winnings, for a balance of <b>Cr71,940</b>.  I could have bought a <b>Viper RT/10</b> at that point, but, instead, I did the following to the Camaro:
[*] Sport Trans, H/H sports tires, WR1  (Cr12,500)
I then won the <b>FR</b> series (no poles) for a net profit of Cr12,500, giving me a balance of <b>Cr84,440</b>.

I wanted to buy the most expensive car I could which was capable (in my hands) of dominating the <b>Normal Series</b>.  A Cerbera was just out of reach at Cr84,800, so I bought a <b>Griffith 500</b> for <b>Cr83,200</b>.  That won all poles and races in the <b>Normal Series</b>, giving me <b>Cr401,240</b>.  At that point, of course, the game is basically over.

To conserve funds and avoid over-powering the competition too much, I tuned the <b>GTO'92</b> a little conservatively:
[*]WR2, NA3, Rmuff, sports brakes, S/S racing slicks
[*]triple clutch, racing flywheel, carbon shaft, H/H stabilizers, computer

I would like to have made no permanent modifications, but found that without weight reduction (WR2 takes it from 3637lb (yikes) to 3090), this car is relatively sluggish.

With that I won one pole (Grand Valley) and all races in the <b>4WD Series</b>, and won all but one race (but no poles) in the <b>GT Cup</b> (coming 3rd at <b>DFRW</b>).  So now I had the <b>Chaser LM</b>.

I won the <b>USvsJP</b> and <b>UKvsJP</b> with the <b>Chaser LM</b> (missing two poles in the first series).  Unfortunately I won neither the <b>Viper GTS-R</b> nor the <b>Cerbera LM</b>, meaning I had to use the <b>Camaro</b> again for the <b>UKvsUS</b>.  (Tuning the <b>Supra RZ</b> I had won from the <b>Normal Series</b> won me the <b>Soarer</b> from the <b>Mega Speed Cup</b>, so I could not try the challenging <b>DB7</b>, either.  I actually cloned the <b>Camaro</b> so I could keep the lightly-tuned <b>FR</b> winner around.

Oh well.  At this point the game is at the point of just needing to be played out.  I'll use the prize <b>Supra RZ</b> in both the <b>All-Night II</b> and the <b>Hard-Tuned Series</b>, and probably for fun use the now race-modded prize <b>Camaro</b> for both the <b>GV300</b> and the <b>All-Night I</b>.

I'll use one of the <b>LM Prize Cars</b>--not sure which--to win the <b>GT-I Cup</b>.

This leaves X and square free, so I keep a digital mapping which is identical but uses X for accelerator and square for brake.  The main problem with this configuration is that I have a tendency to hit the handbrake when going for "rear view".

I still say I'm not a great tuner (nor am I a tuner that tastes great) but, I think these Speed 12 settings indicate something fairly fundamental.

Okay, with the default settings, you spin out all over the place.
With mine you don't.
In fact, you almost have trouble holding it in on some of the corners.
That is understeer.  It allows you to acclerate even on the bumpy bankings without spinning around.

The fundamental change I made compared to the default settings was to
soften the front suspension.

So I claim, contrary to what many tuning guides say, that softening the front suspension causes more understeer, and stiffening it causes more oversteer.  And conversely for the rear suspension.  I have explanations, but will not go into it here.

Most cars in the game which have rear or mid-engines come with softer front suspension as the default setting.  A rear or mid-engine tends to cause oversteer because of the extra outward inertia at the rear.  The soft front settings must be to counter that tendency.

Note, however, that stiffer front stabilizers will cause understeer.  That is because they actually provoke the front into sliding sooner.  (Force which would otherwise cause the body to roll instead causes the inside wheel to lift).  This is the same as what <b>Random</b> said.

Once upon a time there was a young girl named Goldilocks who went for a walk in the forest.  She came across a small cottage which was the home of the three bears.  The bears had all been playing various [b]Sony[/b] [color="blue"]Gran[/color][color="red"]Turismo[/color] games when Mama bear decided they needed some fresh air and exercise, and led them all out for a walk, leaving the three various video game systems running.  (since electricity is plentiful and cheap in Bear Forest).

Goldilocks first went to Mama Bear's screen.  She had been playing the Sunday Cup from the original [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size], so Goldilocks re-entered the series and tried it out.  Three races of only two laps each, all at relatively short tracks.  "This series is TOO SHORT", thought Goldilocks.

Next Goldilocks went to Papa Bear's screen.  Papa Bear had exercised his privilege to use the new [b]PS2[/b] and was racing one of the [b]Professional League[/b] series--ten races of 10 laps or more each! Goldilocks did only one or two races in the series, but quickly decided, "This series is TOO LONG".

So Goldilocks went to Baby Bear's screen.  He also was playing [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size], but was doing one of the International Series--[b]US versus Japan[/b], to be specific; this was 5 races of 3 laps each.  So Goldilocks tried that series.  "Whilst it's true I do need to find a less powerful car in order to make this series challenging", Goldilocks thought, "nonetheless I must say that, in terms of the time necessary to do a series, this series is JUST RIGHT".

So Goldilocks went back to Baby Bear's garage and found a nice underpowered race-modified FF car and went and ran the [b]US versus Japan[/b] series a couple more times, and thoroughly enjoyed herself.

Then she heard the sound of the front door opening...

===============================================================================

Okay, so I'll try to eventually add settings for all ten events here.  I'll start with [b]Monaco[/b]  ([b]C&ocirc;te d'Azure[/b])

I claim my settings are a bit more forgiving than those posted by some expert drivers who never make mistakes and so never have to recover from them.  :D

On the other hand, I'm not a great tuner--in fact I've at times had some serious misconceptions about tuning entirely--so it's possible an expert tuner could improve on these substantially, even while keeping the settings forgiving.

I'm reasonably sure these are the settings I used for the race because I tuned the car first, saved the settings, and then exited and reloaded the game to 1) undo the warmup mileage, 2) well, I might have reloaded to avoid an [b]F094/S[/b], but, well, actually my first reload didn't have one, so I stuck with it (actually I was ambivalent and might have raced against a [b]F094/S[/b]--and in fact someone else says the AI [b]F094/H[/b] actually beat the AI [b]F094/S[/b] anyway).And so I reloaded my settings and immediately qualified first and then went racing... 

F094/S  (C&ocirc;te d'Azur/Monaco)

Spring Rate - 10.0 - 10.3
Ride Height - 49mm - 51mm
Shock Bound - 5 - 5
Shock Rebound - 5 - 5
Camber Angle - 1.7 - 1.0
Toe Angle - -0.5  - 0.0
Brake Balance - 22 - 23

LSD i/a/d  - 5/10/5

Gears:
- 1st - 5.517
- 2nd - 3.564
- 3rd - 2.539
- 4th - 1.902
- 5th - 1.499
- 6th - 1.242
-----------------
- FD - 4.000
(Autoset 38 - I never changed this)
Downforce - 1.00 - 1.50 (max/max)
ASM - 0
TCS - 2

With this I found I could just about stretch to pits every 9.
So I did 9,18,27,36,45,54,62,70 (of 78).

I shouldn't give my race times...  :p
1-49:56.734 - fastest lap 1:18.738
+34.705 over F094/H only
(no F094/S, although someone else reported the AI F094/H beat the AI F094/S at this race).

Given that I won by 34 seconds, then even pits every 8,
8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,(71 or 72)
should still have won, and probably would actually have saved more time than the time of the extra pit stop.
I made lots of gross mistakes (1 every shift after lap 36) so  there's probably at least another 30 seconds I could do better even with my skill-level.

[b]Rationale:[/b]
I found soft springs  work well for me at roughish tracks.  Soft springs logically require an increase in ride height.  (In fact, given the information that many tuners find ride height needs to be raised for [b]Formula[/b] cars, perhaps ride height should be raised even further.  Maximum downforce makes cornering faster once you're used to it--no high speed straights at this circuit.

Low LSD settings greatly improve your speed through tight corners (again, once you're used to it), and allow minor steering adjustments mid-corner to be more effective.  A little LSD on acceleration works a bit like TCS, compensating a bit for sloppy acceleration control.  Similarly I use "no-fooling" ASM setting of 0.  Some camber is necessary on a cornering track, and I'm surprised I used so little, actually.  But camber does increase tire wear, and I remember dialing it down to reduce observed high tire wear.

Differential Spring Rates, Toe Angle, and Brake Balance all give a little oversteer to help you keep the nose in around the hairpin curves.   Shocks are stock; this is a naturally well-balanced car with no exit oversteer to compensate for, for example.  But mostly I left them at something I was comfortable with.  I can believe something with lower bound and higher rebound would work well, too, to give traction around corners and over bumps, but stability on recovery.

===============================================================================

[b]Tokyo[/b]

Okay these are probably pretty uninteresting settings.  I have real trouble driving this track, but switching to these settings did allow me to be at least competitive with the AI.  The principle change I made from previous settings I had used for this track (not shown) was to use full downforce.  [b]HAMMERHEAD7MAG[/b] expressed a little interest in what settings I had used.

F094/S  (Tokyo R246)

Spring Rate - 16.9 - 17.0
Ride Height - 49mm - 49mm
Shock Bound - 3 - 3
Shock Rebound - 7 - 7
Camber Angle - 2.0 - 1.2
Toe Angle - 0.0  - 0.0
Brake Balance - 22 - 22

LSD i/a/d  - 5/12/5

Gears:
- 1st - 5.517
- 2nd - 3.564
- 3rd - 2.539
- 4th - 1.902
- 5th - 1.529
- 6th - 1.322
-----------------
- FD - 4.000
(Autoset 38 - I never changed this)
Downforce - 1.00 - 1.50 (max/max)
ASM - 0
TCS - 2

With this I found I could just about do pits of every 6 relatively comfortably.
So I stretched the first shift to 7 laps and did 7,13,19 (of 25).

These race times are quite pathetic, but at least I won. :p
I qualified only 2nd, because there was an 80's car (F688/S?)  which went fast but wore its tires too quickly.
qualifying time - 1:17.913
34:36.930 - fastest lap 1:17.452
+5.531 over F094/H only (F688/S challenged a bit, but pitted too often)
(no F094/S).


[b]Rationale:[/b]
As I said before, maximum downforce helped me sustain higher speeds around much of the course which is high speed bends.  [b]HAMMERHEAD7MAG[/b] had suggested 8/4 damper bounds but I found softer a little better.  I used a lot of camber early in tuning, and then backed off to reduce tire wear.  I then actually increased the camber on the end getting less wear (rear).  Similarly the cost/benefit of setting toe seemed to me to favour using 0. 

Low LSD settings do help control around corners, with a little LSD on acceleration acting a bit like traction control.   The settings are for generally neutral characteristics since you really want neither oversteer nor understeer on high speed bends.

===============================================================================

[b]Laguna[/b]

These are perhaps the most radically different from what one of those talented drivers suggested.  In particular, I found the default high spring rates made it difficult to recover when I made results on this undulating, somewhat bumpy circuit.  When I ran off into the sand, it took a long time to get back on track.  So my principle change here from stock settings was to soften the suspension, both springs and shocks, subtantially.  To be fair, I must admit that I did incorporate some aspects of some suggestions from overly-talented drivers ([b]NoQuarter[/b] in particular--camber and toe).

F094/S  (Laguna Seca)

Spring Rate - 10.1 - 10.4
Ride Height - 52mm - 56mm
Shock Bound - 1 - 1
Shock Rebound - 3 - 3
Camber Angle - 3.0 - 1.5
Toe Angle - -0.5  - 0.5
Brake Balance - 21 - 21

LSD i/a/d  - 5/10/5

Gears:
- 1st - 5.517
- 2nd - 3.564
- 3rd - 2.539
- 4th - 1.982
- 5th - 1.593
- 6th - 1.327
-----------------
- FD - 4.050
(Autoset 38 - I never changed this)
Downforce - 1.00 - 1.50 (max/max)
ASM - 0
TCS - 1

With this I found I could just about do pits of every 8 relatively comfortably.
So I stretched the first shift to 9 laps and did 9,17,25 (of 33).

These race times are quite pathetic, but at least I won. :p
I qualified 1st (ahead of F094/H, but no AI F094/S); qualifying time - 1:04.118
37:44.973 - fastest lap 1:04.xxx
+19.225 over F094/H only (no F094/S).
(I later did 1:03.451 in (blush) P/All-stars race).
So I come nowhere near the sub-1 minute times achieved by others.
I know, I know, other people better these times even with the underpowered [b]F090/S[/b].
However, at least my settings allow me to keep the car reasonably consistently on the track, as opposed to spending a lot of time off in the sand every second lap or so.

According to my calculations:
avg lap time 1:08.635
approx avg exluding pit stops: 1:06.817


[b]Rationale:[/b]
Maximum downforce helped me corner faster around much of the course which is twisty, with almost no opportunities for sustained straight-line speed.  I used a lot of camber for me.  I used toe settings suggested elsewhere for this course, and they do seem to help you initiate the turns.

Very high ride height, and soft spring and shock settings help maintain traction over undulations, especially if I misjudge the Corkscrew slightly.  The minimal bound setting originated from information from [b]mk[/b]'s program which reveals that the [b]AI Formula[/b] cars all use both bound and rebound of 1.  I found I needed a higher rebound settings for a stable recovery, however.  These shock settings do create a rather humorous effect if you watch the car from behind. :)

Low LSD settings do help control around corners, with a little LSD on acceleration acting a bit like traction control.   The settings are for a little oversteer to help keep the nose in around the turns.  The near-minimal traction control may help induce oversteer through turns.



===============================================================================

[b]Test Track[/b]

This is a useful track to have good settings for.  Suspension, etc. doesn't matter a whole; going fast here is done by minimizing downforce, and setting the top gear and final drive in the optimal range.

F094/S  (Test Track)

Spring Rate - 10.0 - 10.3
Ride Height - 55mm - 60mm
Shock Bound - 5 - 5
Shock Rebound - 5 - 5
Camber Angle - 0.6 - 0.4
Toe Angle - 0.0  - 0.0
Brake Balance - 19 - 19

LSD i/a/d  - 15/40/20

Gears:
- 1st - 5.517
- 2nd - 3.464
- 3rd - 2.439
- 4th - 1.842
- 5th - 1.499
- 6th - 1.327
-----------------
- FD - 3.520
(Autoset 38 - I never changed this)
Downforce - 0.45 - 0.75 (min/min)
ASM - 1
TCS - 5

With this I found I could just about do pits of every 8 relatively comfortably.
So I stretched the first shift to 9 laps and did 9,17 (of 25).

I didn't bother qualifying, and came first.
43:21.782 - fastest lap 1:41.045
+72.883 over F686/M (no F094/S, but I think it loses to F686/M anyway).

Later I used identical settings, except for a final drive of 3.300 in the [b]P/Allstars[/b] race at the [b]Test Track[/b].

There I managed a fastest lap of 1:36.943 by drafting.  However, I didn't beat the [b]R390 LM[/b] because when it went to pit on lap 7 of 15, it rammed into my side and somehow, even though I intended to pit with it, I ended up bouncing out of the pit lane and, before I knew it, was too far down the straight to come back and pit (certainly not in time to catch the R390's draft again).  Without the draft I could not keep up with that car, and so, even though I only pitted once on lap 8 of 15, it still beat me.  What I should have done was pitted on 7, kept the draft, and then not pitted on lap 14 when the [b]R390[/b] would.  Oh well, I'm sure [b]David Hobbs' Mother[/b] had some wise saying which would fit this occasion.  :)


[b]Rationale:[/b]
Minimum downforce is necessary to allow a greater top speed.  Suspension tuning doesn't matter much, but old [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color][/size] wisdom favours high ride height and soft springs at banked tracks.

The [b]top-gear/final-drive[/b] combination must be such that you can easily stay over the power curve peak as you take the car to its top speed.  That way, as you get slowed down by wind resistance or turning friction you drop into a more powerful, not less powerful, part of the power curve.  That is, your final drive cannot be arbitrarily high (ie. it cannot be an arbitrarily low number--a low number since it represents the denominator of the final drive fraction).

Empirically, then, it seems the product of top-gear and final-drive for this car, with minimal downforce, at this track where it appears to be able to attain top speed, should be between 1.327x3.520 = 4.671 and 1.327x3.300 = 4.379.  Even with the latter setting, the car does not decelerate on its own in top gear, but set the final drive to a number too much lower and it will.  Using the lower number means you cannot redline unless you are drafting, but allows you to go much faster when you do catch a draft.  Fifth and sixth gears are as close together as possible, so that there's not too much a jump to get rolling in sixth, and if you do need to drop down into fifth (you shouldn't need to with either set of settings) it won't slow you down too much.

LSD settings are stock, and brakes are irrelevant.   Camber and toe is low mostly to reduce tire wear.  The banking provides traction and the corners are very gradual anyway, so the handling advantages of camber and toe are not relevant.



===============================================================================

[b]Seattle[/b]

This is really the last track where I found my settings made a big difference.  Well, I suppose [b]Rome[/b] and even [b]Apricot Hill[/b] need reasonable settings, but I'm not really sure I've worked them out yet.  [b]Midfield[/b], [b]Grand Valley[/b] and [b]Super Speedway[/b] are easy enough that settings there aren't super-critical.

In fact, for [b]Midfield[/b] I usually used my [b]Seattle[/b] settings so that I could get used to them.  (That is, so I would not get surprised by loading new settings for Seattle). 


I tried the [b]Seattle Formula Race[/b] a couple of times before doing the series, and also did the [b]Enduro[/b] with the [b]F094/S[/b] to check my timing.  My initial results were pretty dismal, but through a combination of tuning and practice I got better.  Of course, a combination of tuning and practice can make it difficult to tell which one of them really helped...


F094/S  (Seattle)

Spring Rate - 10.0 - 10.3
Ride Height - 45mm - 50mm
Shock Bound - 5 - 5
Shock Rebound - 5 - 5
Camber Angle - 0.6 - 0.4
Toe Angle - 0.0  - 0.0
Brake Balance - 22 - 22

LSD i/a/d  - 5/14/5

Gears:
- 1st - 5.517
- 2nd - 3.564
- 3rd - 2.539
- 4th - 1.902
- 5th - 1.499
- 6th - 1.242
-----------------
- FD - 3.950
(Autoset 38 - I never changed this)
Downforce - 1.00 - 1.50 (max/max)
ASM - 1
TCS - 3

With this I found I could just about stretch my pitstop to every 10 laps.
So I stopped at laps 10,20,30 (of 40).

My embarrassing stats, again...  :(
I qualified first, with 1:15.604, and finished first.
52:55.528 - fastest lap 1:13.605
+1 lap over F094/H (no F094/S)

[b]Rationale:[/b]
This is a circuit with a lot of turns, some reasonably fast, and not a lot of straights, so maximum downforce helps.  To handle the bumps and hills, some softness of suspension and raising of ride-height helps.  Shocks are stock, but these settings are basically early ones, and I might fiddle with them a bit more now, although you do want some stiffness to help you keep or regain control, e.g. going up <em>that</em> hill.

Low LSD settings do help control around corners, with a little LSD on acceleration acting a bit like traction control.  With the bumps at Seattle, sometimes LSD and TCS helps prevent excess wheelspin from turning a mistake into a disaster.  Maybe.

The settings are for a little oversteer to help keep the nose in around the turns.

Zero toe, and low camber help reduce the tire wear.  Perhaps more camber would be a wise idea to help cornering.  To tell the truth, the low camber is mostly left over from initial tuning at [b]Midfield[/b] where there is some camber of the track to act as banking on some turns.  And perhaps I was tuning mostly to extend tire wear.

<em>In general, I had thought the whole algorithm was a lot more complicated than it in fact turns out to be.</em>

1) I had thought that changing oil early and/or frequently would delay the permanent power losses.   [b]No, it doesn't.  Permanent power loss is based entirely on mileage.  An oil change simply gives an engine a "power boost" which lasts for 200km, then gradually drops over the next 100km until the oil light comes on 300km after the oil change.[/b]  I<em> still wonder whether the oil in a brand-new car "should be" shown by the game as brown</em>

2) I had thought that watching the stress on your engine, primarily avoiding over-revving, might affect the peak power you attained, and the eventual power loss.  [b]No, it doesn't.  Permanent power loss is based entirely on mileage (as is oil "consumption").[/b]

3) I had thought that how well you "broke-in" an engine might affect its eventual terminal minimum and maximum power levels (before and after an oil change).  [b]No, it doesn't.  Permanent power loss is based entirely on mileage; every model follows a formula based strictly on mileage, and nothing else.[/b]

4) I was just in the process of discovering that the power gain and loss patterns were different for prize cars and purchased cars.  [b]Yes, dealer purchased cars gain power as you initially drive them, up to 300km and then after 800km lose power until 900km when they settle in to terminal values.  Prize cars are already at the peak power that the equivalent purchased model would obtain, and after 500km begin losing power until 600km.[/b]

5) That is, I previously thought you should break in prize cars.  [b]No, assume prize cars are broken in already.  Change their oil and start racing. Expect a loss in power because of the oil, and a permanent loss in power because of mileage, as indicated above.[/b]

6) I had thought one should be stingey with one's qualifying laps to conserve oil.  I even resorted to things like entering an Endurance Race, qualifying with lots of practice laps, exiting, reloading the game and qualifying again (or perhaps not) to conserve oil.  [b]No.  That is not necessary.  Qualifying laps do not count for total mileage at all, and, since both the temporary power losses due to oil, and the permanent power losses due to mileage are based strictly on mileage, neither permanent nor temporary power losses will be incurred by any amount of qualifying.[/b]

7) I had thought that if you never changed your oil, power would keep getting worse and worse and worse.  [b]No.  For each car there is a base value  below which the power will not drop no matter how far you've driven the car, or how long ago you changed its oil.[/b]

===============================================================================

Here is an example of how long a GT3 series can take.
I originally contemplated doing the Formula GT, but decided I was out
of practice, and so did the Polyphony Digital Cup (for normal cars)
instead.

Sunday, November 17, 2002

11:11am select red F094/S (no breakfast yet)

12:40pm start F1/Seattle race
 1:52pm finish F1/Seattle race (i.e. exited End Screen)

Okay, so I lost.  So I took a break, deciding what to do.
I decided that I need to have had a lot of recent package for the
Formula GT Series (10 races of 30laps+), so I decided to see if I could
squeeze in a Polyphony Digital Cup (10 races of 20laps).

Twenty-four hours of Gran Turismo One ?

Okay, over the holiday I set myself a challenge and didn't quite manage it.  It seems to me one should be able to complete [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] in within a single twenty-four hour marathon gaming session.  (Using a [b]PS2[/b] for reliability might be advisable).

By "complete", I mean at least get all gold cups in simulation mode.  You might also want to finish arcade mode and the spot races (which earn "invisible cups"; the game does record that you have won them but doesn't make that information visible to you (unless you have a [b]Game Shark Pro[/b] or something like a [b]Dex Drive[/b]).  I do not, however include getting all gold license test cups.  (This is reasonably equivalent to getting "[b]100%[/b]" in [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]2[/size] or [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]3[/size], which does not require gold license test results either).

When I play, I usually take fairly copious notes of my game progress.  For the endurance races I actually record all laps (preferably entering them into my computer so I can check for accuracy before finishing; for the [b]Grand Valley 300[/b] I like to check a particular location with a [b]Game Shark Pro[/b] to get my finishing time in thousandths).  That actually takes me close to an extra hour for each endurance race after actually finishing.

So playing my normal way, taking my notes, I started at 4:15pm on Saturday December 28, 2002.  By four in the morning I had completed all A license events and finished up my IA license.  It seemed to me that my IA times were a little slow, and I was having difficulty staying awake so I decided to sleep for about 8 hours.  I'm an old **** so two hours sleep no longer rejuvenates me like it used to.

I began playing again at 12:10pm on Sunday December 29, 2002, and finished simulation mode, including Spot Races, by 10:47pm  (that included about 7 hours doing 4 hours of endurance racing, you remember, because of my note-taking).  I used my [b]PS2[/b] for all races except the [b]GV300[/b] where I used a [b]PSX[/b] so I could use my [b]GameShark Pro[/b] to check the thousandths on my finishing time.  I kept all failed license attempts (only 1 in B and A).  Wanting to start with a cheap red [b]FC RX-7[/b], I did [b]B[/b]. [b]A[/b] and two [b]IA[/b] tests (plus one [b]A[/b] failure) before beginning by buying an [b]RX-7[/b] on day 20  and then winning the [b]Sunday Cup[/b].  I did lose one series; I traded the [b]Demio[/b] for an [b]FTO'94 GPX[/b] but did not manage to beat the [b]Integra[/b] in the [b]FF[/b] series the first time.  I did, however, manage to do the races in license test order, not entering any [b]A[/b] license events until I had finished all five [b]B[/b] license events.  (I initially ignored [b]Spot Races[/b]).

The [b]Mitsubishi GTO'92 twin turbo[/b] was my car of choice for [b]4WD[/b] (lightly tuned) and, maxed, for the [b]Mega Speed Cup[/b] and [b]Hard-Tuned Series[/b].  For some reason I used it in the [b]Grand Turismo Cup[/b], too.  Practice for the [b]Tuned[/b] series?  Plus that was very late at night (early in the morning) and my concentration was going).

Apart from that I, in general, however, tried to avoid overpowering the competition, using the race-mod version of the [b]FC RX-7 GT-X[/b] quite a lot.  I used that in [b]USvsJP[/b] and [b]UKvsJP[/b] and the two race-mod endurance races.  I couldn't resist using the prize [b]Cerbera LM[/b] for [b]UKvsUS[/b], and the game-ending [b]GTI[/b] series, however.

After finishing [b]Simulation Mode[/b] at 10:47pm I decided to do Arcade Mode, just mashing my way through with all the "ringers".  Somewhat to my shock, an NSX beat my Corvette'67 the first time at Grand Valley.  But apart from that I didn't lose any races.  That took me until 12:49am.

So my elapsed time was just over 32 hours, and, removing the 8 hours of sleep, the time I used was just over 24.  But as I say, that includes a lot of time for note-taking.

So that was sort of fun.  It sure seems to prove that [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] as a game is a lot more manageable than [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]3[/size].

And I'm sure some other nutter must have previously completed [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] in this fashion in one waking session, in well under 24 hours.  Although using a [b]PSX[/b] instead of a [b]PS2[/b] might cause some overheating and reliability problems.

So how were your holidays?

Okay, here's what I mean.

Here's a not atypical [b]GV300[/b] result from [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size].

Car: Nissan [R]Fairlady Z Version S Twin Turbo 2 Seater
Qualified: 1st(+0.869) 1:43.661new  Cr20,000
Result: 1st
1st:* [R]Z 2seater turbo -- 1-38:50.0new
2nd:  [R]GT-R LM ----------- +248.043  (1-42:58.0) 2 laps
3rd:  [R]Impreza Rly Edition +294.377  (1-43:44.4) 2 laps  8-(
4th:  [R]EXIV 200GT -------- +413.804  (1-45:43.8) 3 or 4 laps
5th:  [R]Lancer EvoIV GSR -- +450.995  (1-46:21.0) 4 laps
6th:  [R]Accord Sedan ------ +600.800  (1-48:50.8) 5 or 6 laps
Pits:  12,24,36,48
fl(4): 1:34.444new

Note how the "AI" EXIV 200GT beats the "AI" Lancer.

Here is my win with the [b]EXIV GT[/b] (pretty close, would be difficult to repeat)...

Car: [R]Corona EXIV 200GT
Qualified: 6th(+2.359) 1:47.451not
Result: 1st
1st:* [R]EXIV 200GT ------- 1-41:41.2not
2nd:  [R]NSX-R LM GT2 ------- +13.706  (1-41:54.9)
3rd:  [R]R32GT-R'91  -------- +48.932  (1-42:30.1)
4th:  [R]EXIV 200GT  ------- +253.507  (1-45:54.7)
5th:  [R]Lancer EvoIV GSR -- +294.532  (1-46:35.7)
6th:  [R]LANTIS Type R ----- +386.868  (1-48:08.1)
Pits:  15,30,45
fl(48): 1:38.350not

Here is my win with the [b]]Lancer EvoIV GSR[/b] (tuned with only TS3, same as the AI, AFAICT)
A fairly easy win, which I'm sure I could repeat...

Car: [R]Lancer EvoIV GSR
Qualified: 1st(+1.464) 1:43.260new
Result: 1st
1st:* [R]Lancer EvoIV GSR - 1-39:44.8new
2nd:  [R]CASTROL Supra GT -- +152.827  (1-42:17.6) 1 lap
3rd:  [R]GT_R LM ----------- +187.397  (1-42:52.2) 1 lap
4th:  [R]Impreza Rly Edition +239.040  (1-43:43.8) 2 laps
5th:  [R]Lancer EvoIV GSR -- +385.492  (1-46:10.3) 3 laps
6th:  [R]Accord Sedan ------ +552.599  (1-48:57.4) 5? laps
Pits:  15,30,45
fl(18): 1:35.884new

Interestingly enough, the [b]EXIV 200GT[/b] beat an "AI" version of the same car.  Similarly with the [b]Lancer EvoIV GSR[/b].  Note that my [b]Lancer[/b] beat the AI [b]Lancer[/b] by over two more minutes than my [b]EXIV 200GT[/b] beat the AI [b]EXIV 200GT[/b].  Let alone the fact that the AI [b]EXIV200GT[/b] normally beats the AI [b]Lancer[/b].

Here is the garage where I collected the cheapest instance of all used cars.  I also collected some of the cheapest red, yellow, and sometimes white versions of cars when the cheapest colour was not so bright.

Here is a log for this game:
http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/gt/logs/gt1-mazda.txt

The cheap used cars begin with entry 9.  Before that are the cars I used to complete the game.  There are a few other odd-balls following that (the new Impreza'96 WRX and the hard-tuned 180SX'94 Type X), too, but mostly it's cheapests instances of that particular colour of used car (usually the cheapest price for that used car at all).  I sold most, but not all, of my prize cars.

An in-law decided to buy me a cheap used [b]V3FX (PS2)[/b] wheel, but it came with no instruction manual.  So now I'm trying to find out how to undo all those silly key mappings which seem to have been done, and whether it allows any calibration, etc.

I was hoping to find a FAQ, or rehash of the vendor's manual (or maybe even an online official vendor's manual, although that's unlikely).

I'm not having much luck. Not on this site, nor on the web in general, so any free advice would be appreciated. 

First I started with a search for [b]v3fx[/b] which returned the following list...

Nothing there.

No occurrences of v3fx2--the semi-official name for the PS2 remake of this device--on this board, either.

I finally got [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] track map pages up...

http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/gt/gt1maps/

Or, separated into Arcade and Simulation mode...

http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/albrnickgt/arcade/tracks.html
http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/albrnickgt/tracks/

I'd still like to make the maps better in some ways, and maybe avatar-sized versions, but these will do for now.

===============================================================================

For [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] [b]v1.1[/b]...

The following code will cause the [b]Hard-Tuned Car Speed Contest[/b] to have an AI field of all [b]Civic 3 door[/b]. 
[code]
D008C220 6E68
8008F5C8 0A40
[/code]It does so by bumping the pointer into the field of potential entrants by 28 bytes (7 entries) so that the [b]Civic 3 door[/b] is the only one to choose from.  :D

If you decrement the value 0A40 by 4, you will get additional cars back as potential entrants, as follows:

0A40 - Civic 3 Door (only)
0A3C - (add) Chaser Tourer V
0A38 - (add) Lancer Evolution III GSR
0A34 - (add) Skyline GT-R NIsmo
0A30 - (add) Skyline GT-R Vspec
0A2C - (add) efini RX-7 Type RZ
0A28 - (add) Supra RZ
0A24 - (add) NSX'93 (i.e. entire field)

I'd prefer if people wait until I say I've double-checked this code before trying it.  And even then, the usual disclaimers apply--use at own risk! 
I have tested this code with a [b]GS Pro[/b] only.

Along the way I have noticed, checking many detailed notes in many different restarted games of [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size], that with my version of [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size]  I only ever get one of two fields in this event, either:

NSX'93
FDRX7 Type RZ
R32GT-R Nismo
Lancer EvoIII GSR
Chaser V

or:

Supra RZ
FDRX7 TypeRZ
R33GT-R Vspec
Lancer Evo III GSR
Civic 3 door

First one is "no Supra, no Civic, no Vspec", and second is "no NSX, no Chaser, no Nismo", but, assuming these really are the only two fields I can ever get, I can characterize them as "NSX field" or "Supra field".
===============================================================================

I have now double-checked the codes.  Enjoy.  I believe I have a [b]GS CDX[/b] somewhere and should try testing the codes there, some day...

While testing the alternate versions of the code I suddenly gained insight into how [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] chooses random fields from its internal lists of potential participants.--It always maximizes the number of manufacturers represented.

If it is ever the case that there are five or fewer manufacturers in the entrant list, and that one one of those manufacturers has only one entrant, then that entrant will always be present.  That is the case with this event, and that is why the [b]FDRX7 TypeRZ[/b] and the [b]Evo III[/b] are always present.  (I think the [b]Evo III[/b] is sometimes red, however...)

Also, if the [b]Honda NSX[/b] is present, the [b]Honda Civic[/b] is excluded, and if the [b]Toyota Supra[/b] is present the [b]Toyota Chaser/Tourer V[/b] is excluded.  Similarly, at most one of the two [b]Skyline[/b] models is present.

Now that would seem to suggest 8 possible fields:

NSX,Supra,RX7,Vspec,Lancer
NSX,Supra,RX7,Nismo,Lancer
NSX,RX7,Vspec,Lancer,Chaser
NSX,RX7,Nismo,Lancer,Chaser
Supra,RX7,Vspec,Lancer,Civic
Supra,RX7,Nismo,Lancer,Civic
RX7,Vspec,Lancer,Chaser,Civic
RX7,Nismo,Lancer,Chaser,Civic

I think I've got that right.

However, in the Tuned Series you apparently never get both the Chaser and the Civic, so that eliminates two fields.  Similarly, you apparently never get both the NSX and the Supra, so that leaves just four potential fields, and, as far as Ican tell, the Nismo appears with the NSX, and the Vspec with the Supra.

The [b]SSR11 All-Night II[/b] event uses the same set of competitors, but they are listed internally in a different order, and I have seen different combinations; in particular I have seen both the Chaser and the Civic appear in the same race, and both the NSX and the Supra.  And also fields with neither of each of those pairs, and some with only one from those pairs, making for more varied competition.  But yes, the Lancer and the RDRX7 are both always there.

===============================================================================

This phenomenon of maximizing the manufacturers explains a few other interesting facts about [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] fields.

That [b]Impreza Rally Edition[/b] in the [b]USvsJP[/b] really will appear every time, because the competitor list for that event represents only five manufactures; Chevrolet, Dodge, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Subaru, and the [b]Impreza Rally Edition[/b] is the only [b]Subaru[/b].

For similar reasons, there is always a [b]Mazda Demio GL-X[/b] and a [b]S14 Silvia Q's[/b] entered at the [b]Sunday Cup[/b].

In the [b]Lightweight Battle Stage[/b], only four manufacturers are represented--Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota.  The only [b]Mazda[/b] is again the [b]Demio GL-X[/b], so it is always present.  But because there are only four manufacturers to choose from, not only do the fields always a duplicate entry from one manufacturer, they often have a duplicate of the same model of car.  The game ensures no manufacturer has more than one entry unless it is necessary, but it does not apparently attempt at all to avoid duplicates of the same model once it has decided that some manufacturer must have more than one entry.  In fact, when I used the code to restrict the Tuned series to [b]Lancer, Chaser, Civic[/b], I actually got fields of [b]Lancer, Chaser, Chaser, Chaser, Civic[/b] and [b]Lancer, Chaser, Civic, Civic, Civic[/b].  So once each manufacturer has been represented once, the game seems to stop trying to be any more fair.

Similarly, the [b]UKvsUS[/b] event has only four manufacturers represented--Chevrolet, Dodge, TVR and Aston-Martin, and so duplicate entrants often appear there.

I didn't realize that the game maximizes the manufacturers in a race until I set the code to choose from [b]Vspec, Nismo, Lancer, Chaser, Civic[/b] when, to my surprise, it began behaving almost as if there were only four choices rather than five, with the [b]Vspec/Nismo[/b] being "one choice".

But after thinking about it, and then thinking back to all the races I had raced in [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] I wondered why it hadn't been obvious to me before.  If you are racing against an [b]NSX[/b] in the [b]GT-I[/b], [b]GV300[/b] or [b]All-Night I[/b], then, indeed, checking my notes you will not be racing against the [b]Accord Sedan[/b], but until now I had not noticed that fact.

Pages below:
http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/albrnickgt/races/

list the AI fields for each event.  (You need to infer the manufacturers, however).  Those lists of mine would be enhanced by an indication of the number of manufacturers represented, and, if that is 5 or less, an indication of cars which are always present in the AI field for that event.

Oh yes.  Even though there are 48 potential AI entrants for the [b]Trial Mountain Spot Race[/b]. the [b]Corvette'67[/b] shows up relatively frequently, because it is the only [b]Chevrolet[/b] represented--so there's potentially a 5/7 chance of it showing up.  (Chevrolet being the only manufacturer besides the six Japanese manufacturers represented in the list).

===============================================================================

The following code uses the [b]All-Night II[/b] field for the [b]Tuned Series[/b] instead of the usual.  That is the same set of cars, but in a different order, and you do get a little more variety.[code]D008C220 6E68
8008F5C8 0C64[/code]Using that I saw 5 of 8 possible fields in 62 tries.  Ignoring the Skyline  differences, the following are the four interesting combinations, and how often they occurred:

Chaser,Civic    39/62
Supra,NSX       18/62
NSX,Chaser      4/62
Supra,Civic        1/62  (yes, once and only once)

The Chaser and Civic sometimes occurred with a Nismo, and sometimes with a Vspec.   So that gives the fifth combo.  (The FDRX7 and Lancer must always be present, remember, because they are the only representatives from their respective manufacturers).  I *think* the other combos always had a Vspec, but I didn't bring the detailed notes with me.

A couple of days ago I handily won the [b]Tuned Series[/b] using the [b]Honda Civic'93 Sedan[/b].  I had the code from my first posting above in effect, of course.  :)

===============================================================================

I did some more testing of the above code in a more "mature" game of [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size] (about 5923 days), and got slightly different fields, and saw 6 of the 8 possible fields in about 40 tries.  The only two fields I did not see were the two which contain both a [b]Supra[/b] and a [b]Vspec[/b].  A test with the code off in that "mature" game once again turned up only the two fields I indicate above.  ({no Supra, no Vspec, no Civic} or {no NSX, no Nismo, no Chaser}).

Colours of AI competitors?  It seems to me that the colour choices are always biased towards the later choices you have available in the showroom.  Looking at the [b]Civic 3 door[/b] or [b]Chaser V[/b] or [b]Supra RZ[/b] in the new car showroom seems to confirm this.  Amongst other things, this bias tends to avoid a preponderance of white cars in the field which probably would look dull and strange.  True, a white [b]Chaser V[/b] shows up every now-and-then in the [b]Tuned Series[/b], but that is because a certain colour of white is actually about the fourth of 7 colours available for that car.  But usually white is the first choice presented for any particular car.

0:42.854 demo 0:42.949
I seemed to be doing well--silver about every three or four runs, and only
infrequent crash failures.

- easy through first left through tunnel, but no braking necessary
- slow, and brake, but not too much for the first right
- enter the second right a little wide, and cut in
  (this is the trickiest corner of the test)
- if you're on track for gold, you must lift off the accelerator before the second tunnel
- want to exit tunnel lodged in groove, over hash marks

I hit split-time at 0:28.635, well below demo of 0:28.771.
"Stay in groove, ease on gas early--don't blow it", I thought.
I got in the groove, but felt a slight burble on my exit.
"Oh well", I thought, "That probably blew it, but your speed is okay--keep it nailed, away from the edge of the road, and it looks like the upshift will come well before the exit of the tunnel."

I saw the "42" on the stopped clock, and then the "Gold medal" appeared, much to my relief.  I was amazed that I had made it by so large a margin.

"Remember to save replay".
Then I checked the demo once before exiting (although, in fact, you can come back later to do that).  It showed I got an early lead by cutting over the apron in the first tunnel.  I lost a little in the first right-hander, but perhaps gained it back in the next.  The split time shows I lost a little in the last corner, and finished just barely ahead of the demo (under 1/10 sec).

Well, I finally managed gold on [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]3[/size] [b]B-8[/].

I got [b]0:42.854[/b] to the demo [b]0:42.949[/b].

I had seemed to be doing well--silver about every three or four runs, and only infrequent crash failures.

Here's my summary of the technique I tried to apply:
[list]
[*] easy through first left through tunnel, but no lifting or braking necessary--just try to reduce tire squealing, keeping speed close to 69mph
[*] slow, and brake, but not too much for the first right
[*] enter the second right a little wide, and cut in
  (this is the trickiest corner of the test)
[*] if you're on track for gold, you must lift off the accelerator before the second tunnel
[*] want to exit tunnel lodged in groove, over hash marks, accelerating early, but somewhat gradually
[/list]

In my successful run, I hit the split-time at [b]0:28.635[/b], well below demo of [b]0:28.771[/b].

Then I saved my game, and went downstairs to get another memory card to make a second copy.  :)

Race at Autumn Ring II (full course)

Ah...

The only race at the [b]Autumn Ring II[/b] (full course).   The penultimate race in the [b]Hard-Tuned[/b] series.

I remember....

I remember when I thought the [b]Hard-Tuned[/b] series would be the only part of [b][size=+1][color=blue]G[/color][color=red]T[/color]1[/size][/b] which I would never win (leaving aside the license golds which at that time was an absolutely ridiculous notion).

Then I remember how, after I managed to cheat my way to a win in the [b]Hard-Tuned[/b] series with something like a [b]GTO'95 MR[/b] that I was convinced I would never actually win at [b]Autumn Ring II[/b] in that series.

But time has passed.   And I've got all my gold license test prizes.

And now...

That [b]Autumn Ring II[/b] race is actually the one I look forward to with an outclassed car since it can sometimes scratch out a good placing since power is not overly important at that track.  (Mind you, you need to concentrate on keeping your nose clean for  the first lap--avoiding bad collisions with the AI which can leave you with 5 or more difficult seconds to make up).

Here I don't give a complete solution, but give four minimalist "moves" which could be applied to solve any scrambled cube.  In reality, you use more straight-forward operations to get a base of operation, saving moves like this for when you are "close".

They're also useful for making "pretty patterns".


For convenience I add to MK's notation two non-obvious moves:
[code]
<||
|||  rotate the front face 1/4 turn counter-clockwise
||>

||>
|||  rotate the front face 1/4 turn clockwise
<||
[/code]
These could be effected, I suppose by
[code]
--> ||| <--
--> ||| <--
--> ||V <--

and

--> ||^ <--
--> ||| <--
--> ||| <--
[/code]
respectively, but that's a little "wordy".


(1) FLIP TWO EDGE CUBIES

In any case, my way to flip two edge cubies, and only two edge cubies...
"x" is the hot seat...
[code]
|x|
|||
|||
[/code]
Follow that cubie in the following:
[code]
||> --- <|| <|| --- --- ||>
||| --> ||| ||| --> --> |||
<|| --- ||> ||> --- --- <||
[/code]
Do you see how it was put down from its top slice, slid to a position in the back, and then brought back up in the opposite orientation?  If you get the moves right with a real "pristine" cube, at this point you should have the top face correct, except for the flipped cubie, and the rest of the cube is somewhat a mess.

So apply one, two or three [1]
[code]
-->
---
---
[/code]
To bring another edge cubie to the "hotseat".  Now exactly reverse the sequence of moves you did before.  That is, reverse each move, and do those moves in the reverse order.  This will flip the second cubie, but undo the mess of the rest of the cube.
[code]
<|| --- --- ||> ||> --- <||
||| <-- <-- ||| ||| <-- |||
||> --- --- <|| <|| --- ||>
[/code]

Now apply one, two or three
[code]
<--
---
---
[/code]

To undo what you did in [1].

Now the only thing changed from the original cube position is that the original "hotseat" and one other edge cubie from the top slice have been "flipped".

Summary:
(1) FLIP TWO EDGE CUBIES
[code]
||> --- <|| <|| --- --- ||>
||| --> ||| ||| --> --> |||
<|| --- ||> ||> --- --- <||

Apply one, two or three [1]

-->
---
---

<|| --- --- ||> ||> --- <||
||| <-- <-- ||| ||| <-- |||
||> --- --- <|| <|| --- ||>

Apply one, two or three to reverse [1]

<--
---
---
[/code]


(2) TWIST (SPIN) TWO CORNER CUBIES
The initial top right corner will have its right face brought to the top.  Another corner cubie you select will end up spun in the opposite direction.
[code]
The "hotseat":

||x
|||
|||
[/code]
[code]
||| --- --- ||^ ||> --- --- <||
||| --- --- ||| ||| --- --- |||
||V --> --> ||| <|| --> --> ||>

The hot seat has now been twisted.  Apply 1, 2 or 3 [1]

-->
---
---

Reverse...

||> --- --- <|| ||| --- --- ||^
||| --- --- ||| ||| --- --- |||
<|| <-- <-- ||> ||V <-- <-- |||

Finally apply 1, 2 or 3 to reverse [1]


<--
---
---
[/code]

(3) CYCLE THREE EDGE CUBIES
This will cycle two cubies from the top slice together with the indicated one from the front.
[code]
|x|
o||
|||
[/code]
x - "hotseat"
o -  "target" from body of cube.

[code]
--> ||^ --- --- |||
--- ||| --> --> |||
--- ||| --- --- ||V


1,2 or 3 [1]
-->
---  (Note that "hotseat" is
---  actually in middle of RHS at this point)

Reverse...

||^ --- --- ||| <--
||| <-- <-- ||| ---
||| --- --- ||V ---

1,2 or 3 to undo [1]
<--
---
---
[/code]

(4) CYCLE THREE CORNER CUBIES
Following will cycle two cubies from the top slice and one in the bottom front.
[code]
||x
|||
o||
[/code]
x - "hotseat"
o -  "target" from body of cube.
[code]
--> ||^ --- --- |||
--- ||| --- --- |||
--- ||| <-- <-- ||V

1,2, or 3 [1]
-->
---
---

Reverse...
||^ --- --- ||| <--
||| --- --- ||| ---
||| --> --> ||V ---

1,2 or 3 to undo [1]
<--
---
---
[/code]

There are refinements that can be made.
You may prefer to do the moves in different orientations.
For example, I usually put my corner-target cubie for a cycle in the bottom of the back face.

Last Sunday afternoon (Nov 20, 2005) SPEED TV showed one hour of highlights from the 2005 24 hours of the Nurburgring, a race for "Touring Cars", dominated by BMW's, but also including at least one Nissan Skyline and one Subaru WRX.  I got a scare when the local listings listed something else, but, happily, http://www.speedtv.com/schedule/ proved to be correct.  A web search suggests the race actually took place May 7th-8th 2005.

(Apparently its official name is something like the ADAC Zurich 24 Hours Race on the Nurburgring; including ADAC, anyway).

E.g
http://julesperry.com/ring-2005-jp.htm

The race definitely used the Nordschliefe, and I think the course ran onto the modern Grand Prix circuit as well.  I saw no shots of the Karrussell, so is it possible they used its by-pass?  Most shots were outside of the car, and they never ran a complete lap from inside.  In fact, every time they showed shots from inside it seemed I'd only just figured out where they were when they cut away.

Actual race coverage was, of course, somewhat too condensed, but it did make very interesting viewing (and recording).


===============================================================================

Here's some random thoughts, mostly concentrating on games aspects other than handling, since I am of below average co-ordination and so my handling observations would just embarrass me and not be of use to others. With some bikes I was surprised how intuitively I would learn from my mistakes, however.

In any case . . .
[list]
[*] wife does not like because it doesn't open with van Halen's "Panama"
[*] but the engine sounds are acceptable to her; later I even found I was using TV volume 8 when I usually use 3 - not sure if that was all evening; it did disturb her after she went to bed, however
[*] When you look back, the animation looks under its armpit (neat!) and, I think, slows a little
[*] No reverse tracks?
[*] mostly very intuitive, but seems some bikes are "blessed/charmed", and others too finicky, from few I tried anyway
[*] sim mode layout (top) generally confusing
[*] license display page is nice; Er, would be better if all trophies were visible all the time; I won't greatly miss the popping cones, though
[*] some license tests are very easy (but, of course, subject to my "easy" settings)
 - I think the "avoidance" test is used in real-life
[*] nice touch that you wear "your" clothes in license tests - makes you feel you're really there
[*] license test replay shows wrong finish time? - last checkpoint stays, stopping time does not (J-3 avoidance test)
[*] Can you turn ghost(s) off?  How?  For time trials too?
[*] need general (e.g. license test) record-viewer (complaint about all [size=3][b][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color][/b][/size] games)
- but they did fix the [size=3][b][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]4[/b][/size] bug where triangle doesn't just take you out of viewing records
[*] difficult to make (key configure) tuck natural (but sometimes (arcade?) game does automatically)
[*] no "difficulty" setting for arcade races?
[*] won a super-moped (41bhp) race (GVE) Arcade after a few tries; other bikes I was hopeless at; seem to be some nice 400cc bikes
[*] sometimes identical arcade opponents, other times "A-spec estimate" might be nice
[*] should be able to change "riding style" dynamically (i.e. mid-race), or at very least in pre-race menu
[*] still hard to catch a particular frame in replay photo-mode

[*] detailed adjustable riding form is per bike, I hope?
[*] no day counter, let alone diary - so why 1.5MB save?
[*] lack of day counter hinders my personal notes
[*] no way to save game within sim mode?  (Autosave restricted)

{{unreferenced}}

Some players, especially those with fragile egos, object to the requirement to pass particular license tests prior to being able to play parts of the game.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  For players such as this, the [[GameShark]] was invented.

Some question the relevance of the license tests as training for the rest of the game.  For instance, early tests require the player to accelerate the car in a straight line and bring it to a complete stop in a particular marked zone--something one never needs to do while racing.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Furthermore, other tests require the player to drive either portions or complete laps of tracks used elsewhere in the game, but the tests end if the car goes slightly out-of-bounds.  When participating in the racing portion of the game, however, there are no failure conditions.  That means lines can be altered to take advantage of what is often blatant cheating, so some complain because driving strategy will differ in very fine details{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, although obviously portions of the track learned in license tests serve some benefit while later racing.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Many consider this more an indictment against allowing cheating short-cuts when racing, than a problem with the license tests themselves.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  furthermore, some players consider it a point of honor to always race as if license-test failure modes were in effect.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Still other players consider the license tests an entire game in itself, and enjoy trying to better their times there.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  That is, some players dispute the notion that license tests are required to be training for the rest of the game.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Here's information about the apparently pretty consistent [b]Nrburgring 24[/b] lineups.

In order of appearance...

1s.  Toyota SuperAutobacs Apex MR-S (JGTC) '00
2m.  AMG Mercedes 190E 2.5 - 16 Evolution II Touring Car '92
3c.  Nissan C-West Razo Silvia (JGTC) '01
4f.  Nissan FALKEN*GT-R Race Car '04
5o.  Opel Calibra Trundling Car '94
6a.  ASL Arta Garaiya (JGTC) '03
7s.  Spoon S2000 Race Car '00
8a.   Abt Audi TT-R Touring Car '02
9a   Alfa Romeo 155 2.5 V6 Ti Touring Car '93
10c   CUSCO Subaru Advan Impreza (JGTC) '03
11w.   WEDSSPORT Toyota Celica (JGTC) '03
12a.   Audi A4 Touring Car '04
13a.   RE Amemiya Asparadrink RX7 (JGTC) '04
14b.  BMW M3 GTR Race Car '01
15c.  Chaparral 2D Race Car '67
[i]16v. Vauxhall Calibra Super Touring Car '94 (Only in PAL version)[/i]

I give each number a mnemonic letter suffix.  It helps me a lot when I write out and later look up the fields.  And helped me produce the above list basically from memory.  (later I edited it to make the names more correct).

Anyone seen any other candidates?

The first 25 lineups...

1. 1s, 2m, 3c, 4f, 5o
2. 6a, 2m, 7s, 5o, 8a
3. 6a, 9a, 10c, 1s, 3c
4. 11w, 12a, 10c, 1s, 5o
5. 12a, 6a, 3c, 2m, 8a
6. 13a, 11w, 7s, 6a, 9a
7. 1s, 5o, 6a, 3c, 11w
8. 11w, 7s, 10c, 12a, 4f
9. 12a, 5o, 14b, 3c, 4f
10. 2m, 8a, 10c, 4f, 3c
11. 1s, 5o, 13a, 8a, 3c
12. 4f, 8a, 2m, 11w, 9a
13. 10c, 1s, 5o, 2m, 7s
14. 14b, 9a, 1s, 2m, 11w
15. 1s, 3c, 14b, 4f, 5o
16. 15c, 12a, 7s, 11w, 2m
17. 2m, 4f, 11w, 14b, 1s
18. 2m, 7s, 11w, 6a, 15c
19. 12a, 6a, 8a, 1s, 14b
20. 12a, 6a, 15c, 9a, 8a
21. 2m, 13a, 8a, 5o, 15c
22. 1s, 2m, 15c, 5o, 12a
23. 8a, 14b, 10c, 3c, 9a
24. 4f, 1s, 11w, 5o, 14b
25. 12a, 15c, 2m, 9a, 8a

If you start previews instead of races, the fields will still be from the above list, read left-to-right, except that if a duplicate would occur, a substitution will be made.  Or, occasionally, you can deduce that such a substitution was made when the above lineups were produced.  Similarly, if you do something to offset the start of each field (e.g. start getting race lineups after doing a number of previews not divisible by five), then substitutions will be made to avoid duplicates, and you discover the occasional car which was a substitution for a duplicate.

The first such duplicate appears to be the first 5o, which will be a 1s if there isn't one in the field already.  (E.g. enter/exit one Special Condition race before going to the [b]Nrburgring 24[/b], and you get lineup 3c, 4f, 1s, 6a, 2m).

I did a couple of rudimentary checks of this copy of this list.  I'll try to reverify later.

I initially noted 20 lineups, and then after I switched to a different car and the reset the machine, I checked all those lineups again, and, since they all matched, I decided to note the next five as well.

===============================================================================

This morning my wife asked me how many Friday the 13ths occur in a year.
It depends, of course.  But I decided to do some analysis.

Here's the change of week alignment (above), and thereby (below) derived relative start days for each month of a year:

[code]Normal Year:
  3 0 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 2
 J F M A M J J A S O N D
 0 3 3 6 1 4 6 2 5 0 3 5[/code]

[code]Leap Year:
  3 1 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 2
 J F M A M J J A S O N D
 0 3 4 0 2 5 0 3 6 1 4 6[/code]

Each number (equivalence class) occurs at least once in each variation, so all years have at least one Friday 13th.

Note that if a month begins on Sunday (perhaps convenient to denote by "0"), that month will have Friday the 13th.  That could be construed as portentious.

Max number of Friday 13ths in one year is 3.
- Feb, Mar, Nov (normal)
- Jan, Apr, Jul (leap)

If Friday 13th occurs in May or June, that's the only one that calendar year.

Normal Year Pairs
- Jan, Oct
- Apr, Jul
- Sep, Dec
- Aug is another singleton

Leap Year Pairs
- Feb, Aug
- Mar, Nov
- Sep, Dec
- Oct is another singleton

I.e. months with aligned first 28 days (and therefore also 13th) are:

Normal
- Feb, Mar, Nov
- Jan, Oct
- Apr, Jul
- Sep, Dec
- May
- Jun
- Aug

Leap
- Jan, Apr, Jul
- Feb, Aug
- Mar, Nov
- Sep, Dec
- May
- Jun
- Oct


In the Northern Hemisphere, the April/July pair would seem to be best for motorcycle riding, with March/November not bad.

So a leap year with a Friday January 13th (New Year's Day on a Sunday) is good, as is normal year with Friday February 13th, since those both have 3 Friday 13ths in the year.  Although a Normal Year which happens to have Friday April 13th (so also July) is also good.

Another good question, of course, is what is the longest stretch between successive Friday the 13ths?

Driving Lines (Performance/Track) Terminology Confusion

In my understanding, conventional explanation of racing lines emphasizes the concept of the [i][b]apex[/b][/i] of the line being the point at which the line the driver uses around the corner comes closest to (and usually touches or even runs over), the inside roadway edge.  Assuming relatively circular corners with relatively parallel inside and outside edges, then you arrive at the situation where a late apex allows earlier acceleration, albeit from typically a minimum corner speed slightly reduced from what a symmetrically-fitted curve, with a central apex would give.  (Conversely, an early apex ruins the chances of early acceleration, but might be beneficial if it allows you to carry more speed into the corner, if it is, say, the start of low-speed esses, or perhaps a very short straight).

If the inside edge of the roadway is not neatly circular, however, obvious lines can produce what is called in that terminology "multiple apexes".

However, clearly, the line taken by the car itself can be analyzed for distinctive points.  Typically you "ease" in from a straight line to a portion of constant-radius turning (perhaps only a single point), and then "ease" out again.  (I remember from model railroading that an "easement" is a feature of a real-life railway turns, modelled in "better" model railways).

At some point the line will reach an arc or point of minimum radius.  It would seem to me the centre of that arc (or the point, if the line never holds a constant radius) could be considered a different type of "apex" of the corner.

Typically this "apex" occurs opposite to the conventional apex.  If you apex late in conventional terms, this "squishes" or "kinks" the early part of the line somewhat, resulting in an early "apex" of the line.  Conversely, if you apex early, that forces somewhat of a "kink" on the exit, or a late "apex" of the line.  Therefore, talking about this "apex" (perhaps it has another recognized term?) has the advantage that the time of its occurrence lines up with the time when acceleration can be started.  That is, if this "apex" is early, your acceleration can be earlier, whereas if it is later, your acceleration would be later.

Furthermore, it would seem to be very rarely, if ever, that multiple such "apexes" would occur in a single corner, even if the inside edge of the roadway caused multiple conventional apexes; if there are multiple such "apexes" in a good line around the corner, the corner probably isn't quite a single corner; it actually has small straights within it.

Conventional apexes become points for the driver to aim for, but it would seem their creation would arise as the result of analysis in terms of the "apexes" in the line itself.

But here's what Wikipedia has to say today.

[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_%28racing%29[/url]
[quote]

...

The [b]apex[/b] or [b]clipping point[/b] is often used in motorsport, though other racing sports such as skiing and bicycling have similar concepts of an ideal line.

...

[b]Apex entry and exit[/b]

The entry and exit affects the speed into and out of the corner onto the following straight. An early apex is used to maximize the acceleration out onto the following straight. a late apex maximizes the use of speed from the incoming straight, this is used when approaching a corner where the following straight is allot shorter than the straight before the corner. Hitting the apex in the middle is the main way to take a corner, this keeps a good speed constant into and out of the corner.

For example, a sector of the track is a 1/4 mile straight leading up to a 90 degree corner that leads onto a 100m straight that then turns into a hairpin that follows onto a long straight.  The straight is where the car would have its optimum speed and it is leading into a sharp 90 degree corner, the late apex into the corner would be used to make as much use of the speed as possible. Onto the following straight at low speed, this means less speed up to the hairpin. Because the car will be at a lower speed towards the hairpin, the early apex can be used with minimum braking and maximum speed onto the following straight. this would be the quickest way to take this sector of the track making full use of the speed possible into and out of the corners.[/quote]

I think the explanation is clearly wrong, and contradicts their own diagrams.  (You need to see the article for the diagrams because the legend is not part of the diagram image; they could just as easily have the legend wrong too, but, instead, they have it contradictory).   But, actually, it makes sense in terms of my proposed suggestion that the "apex" of the [i]line[/i] be recognized, in addition to, or instead of the apex of the line with respect to the inside edge of the roadway.  However, to add to the confusion, their diagram itself looks wrong to me.  They appear to assume you can take a straight line after the apex, whereas in fact you still need an easement which leaves you appropriately lined up for the following straight.  So the straight line after their marked "late apex" (which does indeed clip the corner late), actually would run out of road, and actually require another kink because it is not really a feasible line around the corner.

They don't actually give a concise definition for [i][b]apex[/b][/i], but instead merely allude to it.  I have copied the diagram as it is today, and will attempt to host it for inclusion in this thread. 

A true example of the flaws of wikipedia, unless I am very much mistaken.

Thoughts and/or better references?

Take the Concept Car LM and restore its default settings.  (Go to change parts, click the part, click the grey alternatives, then reclick the valid part).

You should get gears of

3.178
2.182
1.643
1.241
1.010
0.929
-----
4.292

There's a table showing

2nd 49
3rd 72
4th 95
5th 126
6th 155mph
 8200rpm

Experimentation suggests that is the speed when the previous
gear reaches 8200rpm.

I.e. 3rd gear will achieve 95mph@@8200rpm.
Eyeballing the chart suggests 3rd gear is 100mph@@8200rpm, or maybe even 100mph@@8000rpm.

3rd gear is ER 1.643*4.292

Plugging into
WD in inches = (speed in mph) * (5280 * 12) * ER / ( RPM * 60 * pi )
gives

95mph 8200rpm => 27.5"
100mph 8200rpm => 28.9"
100mph 8000rpm => 29.6"

A fairly substantial variation.  But we can work with 27.5".

Initial Max Speed test does not seem to go beyond 192 or 193mph.

In the Engine:NA Tuning "Change Parts" screen,
max torque is shown as 439.7lb-ft@@6500rpm
max power is shown as 568hp@@7000rpm

It seems like the car should be easily capable of 200mph.  Let's try to achieve that in 5th gear, to leave room in 6th gear.

And let's try to achieve it at 6500rpm.

ER = (RPM / MPH) * pi * WD * 60 / ( 5280 * 12)

ER = (6500/200) * pi * 27.5 * 60 / ( 5280 * 12)
   = 2.6589

Based on that, let's simply keep the default gearing, but slide the final drive all the way down to 2.700, changing nothing else.

Without changing anything else, the car now easily does 227mph, and that's before suspension tuning, which will help too.

Such a low final drive is probably good for the Maximum Speed test.  Perhaps raise the number for road racing, unless you see yourself running out of revs on the really long straights, like Grand Valley and SSR5.

Also not how close 6th gear is to 5th.  Sliding it to a slightly lower number might be an easy way to get a bit more top speed, although you've got to watch the gap between 5th and 6th; at high speeds it's easy to get stuck in a bad spot on the power curve.

And, in general, if you tweak both gears and final drive, you can leave yourself more flexibility for future tuning.

===============================================================================


Calculating effective  average lap time.

Given:
S = number of laps in a tire shift or stint (whole number)
L = average non-pitstop lap time, in standard time units
P = overall pitstop cost in same units
R = number of laps in the race

Number of pitstops in the race is
N = ceiling(R/S - 1), which gives zero if S >= R
(The -1 occurs because you do not take a pitstop if your tires are worn-out at the end of a race).

Distributing the time for those pitstops over all laps gives
N*P/R
N*P/R (N*P/30) is average cost per lap of pitstops.

That is, average lap time will be
A = L + N*P/R

As R becomes very large that tends towards
A = L + P/S
which is an intuitive figure, and a good mental approximation.  That is, the time penalty for a pitstop is distributed over the laps in the shift.

It is very important, however, to remember that the number of pitstops taken must be a whole number--you either take a whole pitstop or you don't; you cannot take a fractional pitstop.  (In games with fuel consumption this changes, as pitstop length can actually change).

********

We can assert that effective average lap time is approximately


That is, the time penalty for a pitstop is distributed over the laps in the shift.

As a further refinement, realize that the actual number of pitstops will be:

(R/S - 1)  (or zero, if S > R)

That is, you take one pitstop less than the number of laps in the race divided by the length of a stint.

So total time for pitstops is
(R/S - 1) * P  (or zero, if S > R)
*** But R/S - 1 must be whole number ***

Per lap that is:
(R/S - 1) * (P/R)  (or zero, if S > R)
simplifies to:  ** I think this is wrong **
PR/SR - P/R
P/S - P/R  (or zero, if S > R)

*** But R/S - 1 must be whole number ***

So a refinement of our previous approximation is:
A = L + P/S - P/R (or A = L if S > R)

It can be seen that as R gets very large, P/R decreases; our previous approximation was essentially for a race of infinite length.

*** DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR FACT PITSTOP MUST BE WHOLE NUMBER ***

So, to consider how to minimize average lap time, we consider how much decrease in L we need to offset an increase in "P/S - P/R (or zero if S > R)".

0.02 secs per lap?  Not correct.  That assumes you can take a proportionally sized pitstop.
*** ERRORS ****

Assume R = 30 P = 25
N = ceiling(R/S - 1) (gives zero, if S > R)
N*P/R (N*P/30) is average cost per lap of pitstop.

The important thing is the change in penalty as you go down a particular "N*P/R" column.

To clarify a bit, consider just the P=25 columns, since I think 25 seconds is a good approximation of the time taken by pitstops in [size=+1][color="blue"]G[/color][color="red"]T[/color]1[/size].

Notice how once you get to the "realistic" range of stint lengths (6 laps or more), the change in per-lap penalty for taking one less pitstop is less than 1 second.  If you can gain more than 1 second per lap with softer tires, but need only 1 more pitstop, you will have a better average lap time.

After finishing [b]Simulation Mode[/b] at 10:47pm I decided to do Arcade Mode, just mashing my way through with all the "ringers".  Somewhat to my shock, an NSX beat my Corvette'67 the first time at Grand Valley.  But apart from that I didn't lose any races.  That took me until about 12:30am.

With this I found I could just about stretch to pits every 9,
so I did 9,18,27,36,45,54,62,70

With this I found I could just about do pits of every 6 relatively comfortably, so I stretched the first shift to 7 laps and did 7,13,19

These are perhaps the most radically different from what one of those talented drivers suggested.  In particular, I found the default high spring rates made it difficult to recover when I made results on this undulating, somewhat bumpy circuit.  When I ran off into the sand, it took a long time to get back on track.  So my principle change here from stock settings was to soften the suspension, both springs and shocks, subtantially.  To be fair, I did incorporate some aspects of some suggestions from overly-talented drivers ([b]NoQuarter[/b] in particular--camber and toe).

Maximum downforce helped me corner faster around much of the course which is twisty, with almost no opportunities for sustained straight-line speed.  I used a lot of camber for me.  I used a little more even early in tuning, and then backed off to reduce tire wear.  I used toe settings suggested elsewhere for this course, and they do seem to help you initiate the turns.

Low LSD settings do help control around corners, with a little LSD on acceleration acting a bit like traction control.   The settings are for a little oversteer
to help keep the nose in around the turns.  The near-minimal traction control may help induce oversteer through turns.
