Clicking one of the following items will execute a Gear Calculator query as if you
had filled out the form.
</p>
<p>
<!-- (When I fix the Gear Calculator CGI to be like the Car Finder CGI) -->
The filled-in form will be shown on the generated page, after the
results of the query.  Study it to learn how the query is done.  You
can modify it to try a slightly different query.
Note that some results look much better if the window is
reasonably wide.

<ul>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=&final=3.3&tire=26.0&gear=3.6,2.2,1.8,1.4,1.0&rpm=500-8500x500&mph=">
Normal Case, generate a chart for a given set of gear ratios and final drive.
</a>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=final&final=2.9-3.501x.1&tire=26.0&gear=3.6,2.2,1.8,1.4,1.0&rpm=500-5500x1500&mph=">
You can even span several final drives and get multiple charts at once.
</a>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=final,gear&final=3.3&mph=150&gear=1.0&rpm=6500&tire=">
But alternatively, you may want to calculate one thing, perhaps tire size.

</ul>

<p>
Sorry, this tutorial is not great, but it was easy to do.

<p>
Modify existing form values, or fill in appropriate
values in blank boxes.
You should leave one, and only one, box blank, and it will be calculated
for the ranges of the values of the other boxes.
