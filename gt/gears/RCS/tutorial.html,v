Clicking one of the following items will execute a Gear Calculator query as if you
had filled out the form.
</p>
<p>
<!-- (When I fix the Gear Calculator CGI to be like the Car Finder CGI) -->
The filled-in form will be shown on the generated page, after the
results of the query.  Study it to learn how the query is done.  You
can modify it to try a slightly different query.
Note that some results look much better if the window is
reasonably wide.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=&final=3.3&tire=26.0&gear=3.6,2.2,1.8,1.4,1.0&rpm=500-8500x500&mph=">
Normal Case, generate a chart for a given set of gear ratios and final drive.
</a>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=final&final=2.9-3.501x.1&tire=26.0&gear=3.6,2.2,1.8,1.4,1.0&rpm=500-5500x1500&mph=">
You can even span several final drives and get multiple charts at once.
</a>
<li><a href="gears.cgi?reorder=final,gear&final=3.3&mph=150&gear=1.0&rpm=6500&tire=">
But alternatively, you may want to calculate one thing, perhaps tire size.
</a>
<br>


</ul>

<p>
Sorry, this tutorial is not great, but it was easy to do.

<p>
Modify existing form values, or fill in appropriate
values in blank boxes.
You should leave one, and only one, box blank, and it will be calculated
for the ranges of the values of the other boxes.

When you have a form, basically fill in at the top of the form the characteristics, and
the value you want them to match how.
The tricky part is selecting the fields you want to see in the result.
This form makes use of "multiple selection" for those selectors, and
how to do this varies depending upon the version of the browser you are
using.  The Netscape we have here on UNIX interprets any mouse selection
in those lists as a "toggle", while Netscape on my PC requires that
the "control" key be pressed at the same time to work like that.
IE on my iMac requires that the "apple" key be pressed.
The "sort" menus work in a similar fashion, but can be ignored for your
first queries; output will be sorted by the selected fields.

@AAdded a couple of examples.
Gotta think about it more.
There's still some tidying to do.
I really should do the "fillin" thing before showing it to otheres.
