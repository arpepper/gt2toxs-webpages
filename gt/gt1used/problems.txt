- "monaco silver" should be "colton red"; fixed Fri Dec 26 20:51:16 EST 2003



JScript(?) problems:
- need \r in front of every newline
- cannot create arbitrary property of element of document
- apparently cannot use a reference?

- something still fails when a gt1used form is created, even though
  gt1stats appears to work, and pre-existing gt1used URLs appear to work
  - those problems appear size/memory related
  - you can do "quick find" to text-area (or sometimes "new page?"),
    or you can arrange to cut-and-paste the generated URL into a page
    as a link, but I guess there's not enough memory to run selana to
    generate the URL for a new selana to be interpreted
