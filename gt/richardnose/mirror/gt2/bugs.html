<h1>
Gran Turismo 2 Bugs</h1>

There are many bugs in GT2 (too many if you ask me).
<p>While most of these bugs are quite trivial, they point to a product that was very rushed.<br>
I havent listed the well known ones - "less than 100% complete" because it works on the PAL version (remember to do the Event Generator) or the "Speed Test kills my garage" or the "Motorsportland cross country". And dont get me started on some of the silly AI driving!
<p>Here are some that I have found
<ol>
<p><li>In the PAL version you can get 100.91% complete<BR>
To do this, get 100% then restart the game using a language other than English (or in English if you normally play another language). Go to North City and Vauxhall and Opel have been swapped. Go in, buy a Tigra and enter the manufacturer events. This will now think you have won another 2 races and give you that extra percentage!<BR>
That more than makes up for the NTSC 'less than 100%' bug!
<p><li>Some race cars dont have the '<b>R</b>' next to their name when listed
in replays. This also shows up on the "Trade" list.
<br>This includes: ZZII, Espace F1, Ford GT40, Ford GT90
<p><li>The warning messages for the Turbo and NA cups are reversed. Enter
the turbo cup and it says it is for Naturally Aspirated Cars, while the
NA cup says it is for cars with Superchargers/Turbos.
<p><li>Supercharged cars are treated as NA eg. SLK Kompressor and Jag XKR
can both enter the NA Cup, but not the Turbo Cup. This after the Turbo Cup warning mentions superchargers (or it would if it was on the correct race!)
<p><li>You can drive a NA car in the turbo cup!
<br>Enter with a car that is normally NA (eg ZZIII, Mugen Integra Type
R), but tuned with a Turbo. Go into Settings and remove the turbo.<br>
This is more of a novelty than a real bug.
<p><li>The Mini is listed as a Rover (replay and in trade), yet there is
no mention of Rover as a manufacturer.<br>
Was this a "porting" problem when making the PAL version?
<p><li>Some cars are missing suspension parts. eg Elise GT1 doesnt have stabilizers,
Nissan R390 Road doesnt have any suspension adjustment and no parts available
for purchase.
<p><li>GT40 (special model) is a race car, yet it can be tuned.
<p><li>Nissan Special models come without parts. Both the GT-R LM and R390 GT1 Road Car come without tyres, suspension, gearbox etc. Other special models, even non-race ones, come equiped with the standard accessories. If its not a bug, it must be Nissan being very cheap!!
<p><li>Some engine specs are remarkably similar! The Ford Escort and Focus seem to share identical engines, if you go off the power, torque and rev figures. Id guess those Ford engineers have been on holidays for a few years.
<p><li>Older engines allow Computer chip.<br>
This is more of a nit-pick, but older, carburetted engines shouldnt have a computer chip as an option. Then again, probably a lot more cars should have Increase Displacement available.
<p><li>Dirt race times are out of order.<br>
In several of the dirt series, the easier (ie less prize money) races are faster than the harder races. Maybe its not a 'bug' in that it all works. But it is just silly. In the Pikes Peak Downhill, the 3rd race has the best prize money, but is actually the easiest time to beat. It is over 6 seconds slower than the 1st race!
</ol>
<p>
Well thats more than a top 10 list now!
<p>
Ill stop complaining and give GT2 a complement - at least I can sort my garage!!!
