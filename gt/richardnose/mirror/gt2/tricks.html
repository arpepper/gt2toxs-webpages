<H1>Tricks and Tips</H1>
While GT2 doesnt have any cheats (other than Gameshark) there are a few little tricks that are not mentioned in the manuals.
<H3><A NAME="SortGarage"></A>Sorting The Garage</H3>
A big complaint from GT was that it was not possible to sort the garage. This made it very messy for the serious GT fan. Well GT2 has fixed that problem, even if they dont tell you about it.<P>
Go into your garage and go into the car list. Arrow down a few cars, then hit <B>START</B>.<BR>
The car you had selected will now be at the top of the garage!!<P>
So its quite easy to sort your garage how you like. Just remember to start with the cars you want at the bottom!<P>
<H3><A NAME="GoldLicColours"></A>Getting The Spoon S2000 (Gold B License Car) In Different Colours</H3>
With the license tests a lot easier in GT2, it should be within the reach of most people to get all golds on the B license test and earn themselves the Spoon S2000.<BR>
Like some other prize cars, this comes in several different colours. Which one you win is randomly choosen. But unlike prize cars from races, you can not win the gold license multiple times. So how do you easily get this car in different colours, without a Gameshark?<BR>
You could start the game from scratch on another memory card and win all the golds again! No - it is much easier than that.
<H4>What you need...</H4>
Before you start you will need...
<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI>Saved Game with a few free garage slots and about $100,000. <I>This can not have the Gold B license!</I>
<LI>A free memory card. It must have room for a GT2 save.
</UL><BR>
If you already have gold in the B license, sorry, but you will need to start another game. Sorry, thems the breaks!<P>
The first thing to do is to win all golds for the tests, <B>except for 1 test</B>.<BR>
You will need to be able to win the last test easily, so its best to save one of the very easy test. Id suggest one of the braking tests. Number 3 is easy (if you know the <A HREF="#Btest3">trick</A>!) and fairly quick.<P>
<H4>Getting Ready</H4>
Ok, win all the golds except one. This is not that hard. Some of the tests may take a number of tries. But winning them is quite rewarding and it will help your GT driving.<BR>
Make sure you have a couple of free garage spots to hold the cars. You will also need some money to buy the cars. They will cost $48,000 each, so you will need a few hundred thousand.<P>
Once you have 9 golds and everything else ready, save the game back to your main memory card. This will now be called <I>Card 1</I>. <BR>
The other memory card will be called <I>Card 2</I>. This card will get saved on, so it needs room for a GT2 save and shouldnt have any important GT2 saves on it, since they will be overwritten.
<H4>Doing It</H4>
Just follow these simple steps.<BR>
Note:<BR>
Step 1 shouldnt be required the first time, you should already have that game loaded.<BR>
Step 2 is only used when you repeat this procedure after winning a new colour car.<P>
<OL START="1" TYPE="1">
<LI>Load from <I>Card 1</I>
<LI>If the last time you won a car that was a new colour...<BR>
Go to Data Transfer/Trade. Load garage from <I>Card 2</I> and buy the car (should be the last car). <BR>
Now Save this game to <I>Card 1</I> (this should be the only time you save to Card 1)
<LI>Start the game
<LI>Do the license test (and get gold!)
<LI>It should say "new car acquired"
<LI>Save game to Card 2.<B> Be Careful</B>. Do not save to Card 1.
<LI>Go to the garage and eyeball your new car. Note if this is a colour you dont have. If it is, you will need to do step 2 next time.
<LI>Go back to step 1 and repeat.
</OL>
There are at least 6 colours (white, black, yellow, red, silver and blue). You may need to do this about 10 times to get all the colours. Just be careful at step 6 not to save to the wrong card. Also, remember to do step 2 if its a new colour, otherwise that car will not be on card 2 next time you save.<P>
<H4><A NAME="Btest3"></A>B test #3</H4>
This is the braking test with the GTR. This is very easy, if you know 1 simple trick.<P>
Like the other braking tests, its quite easy to learn the correct braking point. But the problem with this test is that the launch of the car at the start is not very good. If you simply rev the car constantly it is near impossible to get gold.<P>
Watch the demonstration. Look carefully at the revs at the start. The throttle is being "blipped", rather than held on. When the car starts the revs drop. Note that they go down under 6000 rpm. That is the secret!<P>
When you start, rev the engine till it hits maximum, then just before the start, release the throttle for a split second. Then when it starts the engine revs will drop. Somewhere between 5000 and 6000 rpm is good. Much above 6000 wont do.<P>
Give this a try and see if you find it easy. Just remember, dont save your main game with this gold, or you wont be able to use this test as the one you repeat to get the cars.

<H3>Any more tricks?</H3>
I hope you found these tricks helpful. If you have any more GT2 tricks you would like to share with the world, please <A HREF="mailto:dax@ihug.com.au">let me know</A>.<P>
