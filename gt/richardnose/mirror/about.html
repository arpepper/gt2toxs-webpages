At my last job (computer programmer for a TV station (<a href="http://www.seven.com.au">ATN-7</a>, in Sydney) I had a GT connection!<br>
The highlight of my work year was to do the <a href="http://www.bathurst1000.com.au">Bathurst 1000</a> race (I did the lap scoring and computer graphics for the televsion.)<br>
This race has a couple of GT connections...<br>
The race is for touring cars. In the early 90s the Nissan GTR came to dominate touring car racing in Australia. After failing to finish in its first race in 1990, it became the first Japanese car to win in 1991. The win wast repeated in 92 (in controversy) before they changed the rules, resulting in the car no longer being eligible.<br>
At about the same time a Nissan 300Z was dominating the Sports Sedan class. Although it was a couple of seconds slower around the track, it reached a higher speed down Conrod Straight - hitting 300km/h<br>
The Bathurst track (Mount Panorama) also hosted a 12 hour production car race. The Mazda RX7 Bathurst model is named after the track because of the RX7s success in that race.<br>
Toyota also sells a Bathurst MR2 model in Australia, but that is not listed in the game (its a non-turbo version)

What do I like about GT2??
<p>
More cars, new tracks.
They kept the feel from GT.
<p>
What dont I like about GT2??
<p>
The bugs! It had plenty and seems very unpolished.<br>
The rally stuff is ok - not up to the standard of other rally games.<br>
It still could become a better racing game. TOCA-2 is still the best racing game Ive played. Closer racing, better info about your position and splits from other cars, pitting lets you select tyres, variable weather makes it more interesting...
<p>
Fav GT2 Cars:<br>
- Escudo! It goes, it goes - it just goes!
- Calibra Touring Car - dont know why, I just like it. Might be the way it revs its head off.

Fav GT2 Tracks:<br>
- Super Speedway - the need for speed, lap times under 25s
- Apricot Hill - nice mix of S curves and a long straight.

Fav GT Cars:<br>
 - 89 GTR, my first 'super car' and still one of the best. Im also a big Nissan fan (only ever owned Nissan cars) and have lusted after this car since it first raced in Australia back in 1990.<br>
 - Impreza Rally, a real easy car to drive. Just so chuckable.<br>
 - Concept Car (US version). This car is ok in the PAL version, but the Jap and US version is so much lighter. In my opinion easily the best all round car in the game.<br>
<p>
Fav Tracks:<br>
 - Grand Valley. Love the track, a good mix of high speed and tight corners. A great challenge.<br>
 - SS5 Clubman. Nice flowing track, fast and fun.<br>
<p>

Lastly: some thanks...<br>
Bob Bell for my first go on a playstation.<br>
Brad the pirate king, for modding my PSX so I could play the US version. And for talking GT and cars at lunchtimes (and most of the rest of our work days!)<br>
Gus the saddie, for showing that "no lifers" can have fun.<br>
Grandmaster, v-turn, squib and others for their websites<br>
Ron "macman" for helping proofread the guides and general inspiration.
Adrian Pepper for being a GT friend.
<p>
Well now that you are truly bored about me, get back to some serious GT action!<br>
