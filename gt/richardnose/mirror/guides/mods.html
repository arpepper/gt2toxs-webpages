<h1>Buying From The Tune-up Shop</h1>
<p>
With so much to buy and a tricky balance between prices and gains, its hard to know where to spend your money.<BR>
Obviously if you have won plenty of money then just buy the top of the line for everything!<BR>
Otherwise - where do you invest your hard earnt credits?
<p>
This guide gives a run down of what parts are good to buy, where to spend and where not to waste your money. It also gives a guide to when to spend money.
<P>
The first section list parts as they appear in the shop. This shows which are worthwhile, which work together and which will become redundant when you buy better parts. This also includes sections on permanent parts and parts sharing.
<P>
The second part gives an idea of in what order to buy these parts. This is especially useful for your first car, as money is tight and you want to maximise your returns (and your fun!)
<p>
One sneaky bit of advice. Check the turbo section, even if the car is normally aspirated. Some NA cars take only a turbo upgrade. Some have even been known to support both NA tune and turbo!
<p>
<h3 align=center>Which Parts</h3>
Many of the parts come in different grades, so which is best? Is it a good idea to buy the cheapest and work your way up? When must I buy the cheapest one to get the next one?<br>
In general, if a part comes in several grades, always buy the top grade. You will want the best part eventually, so don't waste time and money on a part you will replace later.
<p>
Muffler
<ul>
<li>Muffler - only ever buy Race. The others aren't as good and Race is not that much more expensive.
</ul>
<p>
Brakes
<ul>
<li>Brake Kit - is good, it really does help pull the car up quickly.
<li>Balance Kit - is useful, especially if the car gets tail happy under brakes. Not an urgent buy.
</ul>
<p>
Engine
<UL>
<LI>NA Tune - this is a tricky one. The tunes don't work together, so it's good to buy the best, as you will probably want it eventually. This can be expensive, so you may need to do a "step up". If you do this, just do a single step, probably a NA-2 is the best value.<BR>
Not all cars support full tunes. Some may only allow a stage 1. Also check if the car is allowed a turbo kit.
<LI>Computer - a good cheap way to get some power. Will work with the other tuning options, so it can be bought at any time.
<LI>Port Grind- like the computer, it works with other options. But it's not as good value. Best to put your money into other things, especially a full tune.<BR>
Porting is <B>permanent</B>.
<LI>Balance - this is even worse value than porting. Save it till you have nothing else to buy.<BR>
Engine balance is <B>permanent</B>.
<LI>Increase Displacement - like balance, leave this until you want every last HP and have money to burn. Don't worry if it's not available, there are few cars that allow this modification.<BR>
Increase Displacement is <B>permanent</B>.
</UL>
<p>
Mission
<UL>
<LI>Gearbox - get the best, full race support. It's not that much more than the others and worth the extra money. For many cars, especially turbos, it's not needed until you have done the big power gains. Some cars, mainly smaller cars, will need it sooner to help raise top speed.<br>
Be warned! The default gearing in the race box is often far from useful. Excessively low (fast) top gears and bad balance between gears are common. See the <A HREF="gear.html">Gear Guide</A> for details on how to set the gear ratios in the race 'box.<br>
Semi-race (super-close ratio) can have its uses. For some cars (mainly turbos) this will be a 6 speed box, while all the other gearbox options, including full race, are only 5. However the ratios are fixed, often far from ideal and it can greatly limit top speed. But there may be some (rare) times when it is useful.
<LI>Clutch - helps with large power. Get the triple but again wait till you have the power to need it.
<LI>Flywheel - get the race. It helps small engines and high tuned turbos. It's not an urgent buy, but will help.
<LI>Shaft - leave it till last, it's not that great value.
</UL>
<p>
Turbo<UL>
<LI>Intercooler - Get the race. It's worth getting this early as its cheap and will help right away. Its benefit goes up when you get the better turbo.
<LI>Turbo - like the Tune you will want the best. If the car takes a stage 4, you will want this. But as they are very expensive and you may want to step up via another stage. Stage 2 is probably a good balance between cost and power. Just remember you need to save big money for the stage 4.<BR>
Not all cars support full turbo kits, so dont panic if stage 4 is not available for your car.
</UL>
Suspension<UL>
<LI>Suspension - race is best. It may give you much better handling and it does cost a bit, but its main advantage is that it allows you to fully customise the suspension setup. The others are good, but in the end you will want the full race setup. You will need to learn how to setup the suspension to make full use of this upgrade and of your cars potential.<BR>
It's worth checking the defaults, usually they are a good starting point, but in some cars they can cause problems.
<LI>Stabilisers - get hard. These are cheap and really help the handling of any car. Just about the best value for money of any part!
</UL>
<P>
Tyres<UL>
<LI>Tyres - get race soft/soft. These are the best. They cost more, but are worth the money. Don't bother with semi-race or hard tyres just because they are cheaper. Getting the soft tyres will make a huge difference to lap times and to making driving any car easier.<BR>
Other combinations can be used to balance a car, but even then I find soft/soft is still the best and let the suspension help with the balance.<BR>
For endurance races hard/hard (or some other combination) may be worthwhile, but again I have found that soft/soft works well. You gain more time from lower lap times than you loose from the extra pit stops.
</UL>
<P>
Other<UL>
<LI>Weight Reduction - these are cumulative, you need reduction 1 to get 2, so you will have to start at stage 1. They help to improve power to weight, but its cheaper to do this via the power side. However, reduced weight also helps cornering and braking, giving an all round improvement.  The first 2 are cheap, but stage 3 will have to wait till you have some spare cash.<BR>
Weight reduction is <B>permanent</B>.
<LI>Race Body -  This reduces weight and gives better downforce. But most importantly, it looks really cool!<BR>
Race body is <B>permanent</B>.<BR>
Cars with a race body are <B>not eligible for tuned races</B>. Dont worry too much, you can buy another of the same car and share parts.
</UL>
<H4 align=centre>Permanent Parts</H4>
Some of the parts above are listed as <B>permanent</B>. This means that once they are added to your car, they can not be taken off. These are not actually 'parts', but more of modifications and work that is done to the car itself.
<P>
These are:
<ul>
<li>Increased Displacement
<li>Port Grind
<li>Engine Balance
<li>Weight Reduction
<li>Race Body
</ul>
Well the race body is a part, but it also involves a weight reduction and so can't be undone.
<P>
So what is so bad about permanent changes?<BR>
If you want to run your car as stock (Normal) then it can't have any changes. If you add non-permanent parts, you can just select the normal defaults before entering the race. But with any of these permanent parts, you can't de-select them and so your car won't be able to race in the normal race.<BR>
Don't worry too much, that is just 1 race and only a handful of cars are capable of winning that series. If you want to enter the normal series and have a race car, then just buy a 2nd car.

<h4 align=centre>Sharing Parts</h4>

You can share parts between cars if you have 2 cars of exactly the same model. That means you must get them from the same place. In general if you win a car, it is often different from the same model that you can buy.<BR>
So you have 2 of the same car, now any parts you buy for 1 can be loaded on the other at anytime, using the Change Parts option of setup. This applies to turbos, tyres, gearboxes in fact all parts except...<BR>
Ahh there is always an exception. Well the exception is for permanent parts, which we just listed above.
<P>
<h3 align=center>What parts to get when?</h3>

So now you know what parts you want to get, but there are a lot and all up they cost a lot of money (often well over $200k). So where do you start?<BR>
I'll put things into groups, this gives a rough order for buying parts. The first few groups should be able to be bought after a successful race series.<BR>
Each group will have at least one expensive item in with some cheap items. The cheap items are good for when you want to clean out every last cent before racing. But remember you will need
to save to get some of the big ticket items.<br>
The parts will be listed roughly from most to least expensive within each group, so you can see roughly how much you need to save.<br>
<p>
You can skip some of the cheap items in a group if you are saving for the expensive item in the next group. Remember you can check the info for a race series to see how much you will win for each place and the series bonus. That will help you plan your money.<br>
<p>
This guide is not an exact science. Some people will prefer to have "go faster" bits earlier than "handle better" bits. I've gone for what I have found works and it assumes that the driver is a novice. Better drivers will probably have more money and can just kit the car out first go!<br>
Also some things are more important on certain cars (e.g. brake balance on rear wheel drive cars). This can change the order in which you buy some parts.

<h4>Upgrade 1</h4>
These are the best value for money. Get these first, they will make the car faster and easier to drive. The tyres may seem like an expensive luxury, but these will make the biggest difference to a car. The stabilisers are probably the next most important. Weight and computer are cheap and give a bit more 'go'.<br>
<ul>
<li>tyres S+S
<li>weight reduction 1
<li>computer
<li>stabilisers
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 2</h4>
Since upgrade 1 has got the car 'sorted', it's time for some more 'poke'. This upgrade set gets you some more power and work towards the weight reduction. Non-turbo cars can save some money away towards a tune.<br>
<ul>
<li>Race exhaust
<li>Intercooler (for turbo)
<li>weight 2
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 3</h4>
Start to add some trick bits, but also time to start saving money. The gearbox could wait till after the tune/turbo, but often it's better to get is first, especially with turbo cars that can become undriveable with full turbo and the normal gear settings.
<ul>
<li>Gearbox
<li>brakes
<li>flywheel
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 3b (optional step-up)</h4>
If you need power and can't wait...<br>
This is not a bad idea for a first timer, since it will mean a more gradual change to the cars capabilities, rather than an extreme jump from under powered to over powered. It will give you a chance to learn how the car works.
<ul>
<li>NA tune 1 or 2
<li>Turbo kit 1 or 2 (2 is usually the better value)
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 4</h4>
We are getting serious now. Almost full power! Almost full fun!
<ul>
<li>Full tune or Turbo
<li>suspension
<li>clutch
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 5</h4>
Expensive weight reduction, but it's needed for the race kit
<ul>
<li>weight 3
<li>port grind
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade 6</h4>
The Works!<br>
This gives the race body and the last of the trick items.<br>
Are you ready to kick butt?
<ul>
<li>race body
<li>brake balance
<li>engine balance
<li>increase displacement
<li>prop shaft
</ul>

<P>
<h3>Now Race...</h3>
Now you have a full blown race machine. Enjoy it, learn how your car drives and learn how to set it up.<BR>
Remember, you can follow the same upgrade path on your next car. Hopefully you will win money a lot quicker and easier and can do several upgrade sets at a time.
