<h1>Top Speed</h1>

You have probably seen web sites with peoples' top speeds posted. 
Are these speeds way higher than you can get your car to go? 
Even in the same car, you can't get it to that speed?
<p>
This guide will give some tips on how to setup your car to go as 
fast as possible on the Test Track. It will cover a bit of theory, 
but it shouldn't be too technical for most people.
<p>
Using this advice you should be able to get several cars to speeds 
over 400km/h (250mph for the Americans - sorry Im in a metric country, 
with a metric version of GT and a metric brain!). With the right car you 
will do over 430km/h (270mph)
<p>
With drafting you should be able to get to 480km/h - thats 300mph!
<p>
To do this we need to cover bits about theoretical top speed, gearing, 
suspension, downforce and drafting.

<h2>Top Speed - Theory</h2>

First we will cover some theory, where we will ignore the practicalities 
of the track and restrictions on the cars.

<h3>What is a car's top speed?</h3>

Simple question, simple answer. It's the highest speed that a car can do.
<p>
So what affects this?
<p>
We will assume that we have a very long, flat test strip, without the nasty 
corners of the Test Course. Then in theory a car should be able to reach 
its maximum speed, even if it takes a long while.
<p>
The main factors that effect this speed are:
<ul>
<li>power of the car
<li>aerodynamics
<li>top gear ratio
</ul>
At speed, the car is pushing against the air. This takes a lot of effort 
(power) at high speed. Most of the car's power is used doing just that 
(some is lost in friction and rolling resistance, but they are small 
compared to air resistance)
<p>
So we can see that the power and aerodynamics are the main factors. 
<p>
Why does the top gear ratio make a difference?
<p>
Because we need maximum power to be happening when we are at this maximum speed!
<p>
In top gear, for any given speed the engine has a certain number of revs. 
We know that maximum power is at some number of revs 
(see <a href="power.html">Power and Torque Curves Guide</a>.) 
So top gear (and the final gear ratio) must be set so that the car is 
doing that speed at the revs of maximum power.
<h3>Getting to that speed</h3>
That theoretical top speed is all nice and good if someone tows me to 
that speed and lets me go. Yes the car will be able to hold that speed, 
but was it capable of reaching it on its own? Maybe, maybe not!
<p>
So why wouldn't a car be capable of reaching that speed. It obviously has 
the power to do that speed, so why might it not be able to get to that speed?
<p>
Let's assume that the car is in top gear and at maximum speed. It is generating 
maximum power. Now something happens to slow it down (back off the throttle, 
turn the airconditioner on, hit a few big juice bugs - that's like extra 
wind resistance!). What happens? The car will slow a small amount. The engine 
revs will drop a small amount and hence the engine power will drop a small amount 
(since we were at the maximum). But the wind resistance will also drop.
<p>
So did the wind resistance drop as much as the power? This depends on the engine. 
But with a peaky engine (you did read that Power Guide...) such as some turbo 
engines, the power drops quickly with revs. We may have lost more power 
than we need to keep this speed. This means that the car will slow some more. 
This may continue with the car slowing right down unless we change gear.
<p>
The reverse is also true. The same car with the same gearing wouldn't be able 
to accelerate to its top speed because at lower revs it won't have the power 
for the corresponding speed.
<p>
So the engines power curve may make it impossible to actually reach top speed. 
If that is the case, how does the car get to that speed? There are many ways:
<ul>
<li>via another gear
<li>drafting
<li>going downhill
</ul>
<p>
Having another gear, so that at just a bit slower we are in a lower gear,
doing just about the revs for maximum power, will let the car accelerate. 
Then change into top gear when we are much closer to the revs of maximum 
power. In theory every engine needs this, it is just a matter of what revs 
the top gear can pull from. Peaky engines may only be able to pull from 
a few hundred revs below maximum. A strong engine may pull from low revs. 
But no petrol engine will pull from no revs! So without a clutch we are 
happy to burn, we will need some other gears at some point.<br>
<p>
Drafting reduces the wind resistance and can get the car to a speed 
that it couldn't reach otherwise. It will also let the car get to a speed 
higher than top speed - which is what most people think of drafting. But 
in bike racing where drafting is common, bikes pull out of the draft and 
can keep the speed, a speed they wouldn't be able to reach otherwise. 
This is because the bikes are not at maximum speed, it is just that they 
don't have the time (distance) to reach top speed - but drafting gets them 
there quicker.
<p>
Going downhill can give you a boost, but once on the flat you could hold 
that speed.
<p>
These tricks are good, but not really that useful for the real world. 
Also, even if the power curve lets the car reach maximum speed, it may 
take a long while. So we need to move away from the theoretical top speed 
and get back to something a bit more practical.

<h2>Real World Top Speed</h2>

Obviously without infinite time and distance it is hard to reach the 
theoretical top speed. So what other factors affect us on the Test course?

<h3>Real World Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li>weight
<li>corner speed
<li>gears
</ul>
Since on the Test Course we don't have infinite room, we need to 
consider the acceleration of the car. Obviously lower weight means 
better acceleration, thus giving us a higher speed before the next corner.
<p>
For the Test Course the entry speed out of the corner is a big factor. 
The quicker we enter the straight, the quicker we will be at the end. 
The suspension as well as driving technique affects the cars exit speed 
and hence its top speed.
<p>
The number of gears lets us use the power band of the engine better,
giving better acceleration. The possible range of each of the gears 
(the maximum and minimum value) and hence the speed range for each gear
plays a part. Having a 7 speed gearbox, but with 5th gear having 
a very low top speed still only gives us 2 gears (6th + 7th) to use
for our top speed test. 

<h3>Gearing for Top Speed</h3>

When setting the gears for top speed we naturally start with the top 
gear (5th or 6th, or 7th in some cases) and work our way back. However, 
we often hit the limit of one of the gears, in that it can't go any lower 
(faster). So any gear that can't go as fast as the speed we exit the corners 
won't play any part in determining our top speed, as long as they can get 
us to that exit speed (which is usually quite easy). This means that 1st, 
2nd, often 3rd and sometimes even 4th gear play no part in top speed.
<p>
Well that makes it much easier to work on the top 2 or 3 gears. So we can 
concentrate on them and get them right.
<p>
Lets get started..
<p>
First lets assume the car has 6 gears... The techniques work with 5 and 
7 gears, just that most special and limited edition cars have 6. And it 
is much easier to say "5th" rather than "2nd top"!
<p>
The easiest place to start is to set the lower gears and the final ratio. 
It is often best to just set the final ratio to minimum (fastest) and 
then set 4th get to minimum (fastest). Then set 1st so the car will get 
away well (it may need to be high with final drive so low). 2nd will 
probably have to pull from low revs, as will 3rd, since we have to cover 
a lot of speed with just a few gears.
<p>

<h3>Suspension</h3>

The suspension does most its work on bumps and in corners. The Test Course 
has a bit of both! It has 2 banked corners and a surface that is not very 
smooth, like a lot of small bumps. Although these bumps are very small 
at high speeds they can cause a lot of problems with a car, especially 
in the banked sections.
<p>
The best way around these problems is to let the car go quite softly, 
setting the springs and damper to minimum. This stops the bumps from 
making the car bounce. Normally this would be bad because it would 
mean that the car wouldn't turn into corners well. But with a simple 
banked corner it is not too hard to get the car around even with such 
a soft suspension.
<p>
Ride Height is a bit trickier. The best setup tends to be minimum at 
the front and maximum at the rear. The high rear setup lets the rear 
wheels have plenty of travel, almost like softening the rear springs a 
bit more. This helps keep the rear wheels on the road. This assumes 
that the car is rear or 4wd, which all the powerful cars are!
<p>
Having the front low helps lower the aerodynamics of the car as well 
as helping the front turn into the corner.
<p>
Camber is best to be set low as well. Its job is to get the tyres 
at a good angle when a car turns, but at a slight cost to straight 
line performance. Normally this is good, as corner speed and handling 
are very important to lap times. With the Test Course and top speed 
we need to worry about our straight line performance as well. So it 
is better to move camber down from its typical settings.
<p>
Experiment with the suspension and see how different setups affect 
both the cornering and straight line performance.

<h3>Downforce</h3>

Downforce is when the car has wings and other aerodynamic parts that 
are used to push the car down on to the road. This, like just about 
everything else, doesn't come for free. The cost here is that the force 
down also comes with a force against the car in extra wind resistance.
<p>
Setting the downforce higher will give the car better grip, very handy 
on high speed corners, but at the cost of speed. But we do have a 
high speed corner and want to grip there, but also want top speed.
<p>
The corners in the Test Track are banked, so that they actually require 
less effort for the car to make the corner. This means we can get away 
with less downforce than if they were flat.
<p>
Some cars will have trouble with the corners, but loosing some speed 
due to sliding is a worth while trade off compared to the extra acceleration 
and speed on the straight.
<p>
So it is generally best to set the downforce to minimum.


<h2>Running The Max Speed Test</h2>

After all those good hints, it's about time to go a do it.
<p>
<h3>Line, line, line</h3>
The most important part of running the course is your line 
through the corner. Keep this steady, off the grass and off 
the wall and you will do well. Remember an extra bit of speed 
coming out of the corner is that extra bit of top speed!
<p>
Try and turn in early, hold it steady and if possible keep it 
near the white line. The track is smoothest (and fastest) in 
the visible tracks. Slide above those and its hard to come 
back down and hard to keep off the ripple strip at the top.
<p>
When possible, ease out of the corner and let the car settle 
early, the earlier it settles, the longer the straight will be.
<h3>Manual Gears</h3>

Even if you only ever race with an automatic gearbox, this is 
the place to try a manual. It can make a big difference and 
will let you set gear ratios that just wont work with the 
automatic (hint: over rev the lower gear)

<h3>How to get free laps</h3>
When you go to the test track to do a Max Speed test, you get only 2 laps. That is not a lot, especially when cornering technique 
and manual gear changes add an element of human variation. So how 
do you get to do your best?
<p>
<b>Cheat!</b>
<p>
When you start the test, turn around and run the course backwards. 
This lets you run as many laps as you like. That way you can practice, 
try different things and have plenty of goes without having to restart 
and get up to speed each time.
<p>
If you get a speed you are happy with, turn back around (the hand brake 
is good for this at real high speed!!) and go in the normal direction. 
Otherwise if you aren't happy, hit the START button and then either pit 
or exit.
<p>
Now keep this quiet - we don't want everyone knowing this secret!

<h2>Drafting - 300mph+</h2>

Drafting was mentioned above as a way to improve top speed and luckily 
it works in GT!
<p>
Speeds of over 300mph (480km/h) have been done.
<p>
The thing with drafting is that we need other cars, so this means 
the max speed test is out!
<p>
There are a couple of pains with drafting. You have to rely on AI cars, 
which are out of your control. This means its not as consistant as the Max Speed test.<br>
To get the speed, you need to watch the 
speedo and possibly replay the race to check the speed
<p>
These are small downsides compared to the thrill of hitting a blindly fast speed. So lets go drafting...

<h3>Where to go Drafting</h3>
The Test Course is the fastest circuit, but the only race on it 
is in the Mega Speed series, so that is where we will do our drafting.
<p>
The other cars (the AI cars) in the race are not race moddified, but they 
are powerful and fast. The GTO is the best of these, but the Supra RZ is 
not far behind. Its really good to get both of these, this can give you 
a very fast double draft!
<p>
Race the first race, the high speed ring, then go to the next race at the 
test track. I usually skip qualifying, but you should use the Test Run option 
to run your car and check the gear settings.
<p>
<h3>Drafting Gear Settings</h3>

We want to go faster than we did in the Max Speed test, drafting will 
give us the boost to do so. But to maximise this we will have to 
aim a bit higher with our top gear. By moving top gear higher we are
planning to have max power at a higher speed - a speed we normally 
would not reach.
<p>
You can just lower the top gear ratio a bit (say take 0.100 off), 
but I prefer to be a bit more scientific. 
So grab a calculator and we will work out the gear ratio.
<ol>
<li>Pick a speed you think you should be able to do [first guess is to add
about 10-20mph (15-30km/h) onto your top speed from the Speed Test.]
<li>So to do this new speed at the same number of revs we need to be going<br>
(new speed/old speed) faster
<li>This means the last gear should be<br>
new gear = old gear * (old speed / new speed)
</ol>
Note: the new gear ratio should be lower, meaning faster.
<p>
Put that new gear ratio in and now we can try and draft to get that speed.
<h3>Getting the Draft</h3>

To draft you want to be very close to directly behind the other car. 
You can be a reasonable distance back and still get a good draft, so 
its best to start well back as you enter the straight, to get the draft 
for as long as possible.
<p>
The trick is then to pick your speed and how far back to enter the 
corner before you draft the straight. The AI cars go fairly slow around 
the corner and often make mistakes coming out. A quick guess is you can 
be about half the corner back, but it will depend on your car, your speed 
and a bit of luck! In the end experience will help you learn how to guess 
this distance.
<p>
Entering the straight, get in line behind the other car and go for it. 
Change gear (if manual) when required, but generally just sit behind 
the other car. You will start to close on it, but be careful, you will 
be catching it rather fast.
<p>
Smoothly pull out and around the other car. You should keep accelerating 
for a while after passing. Ideally this will be at about 3/4 of the 
length of the straight and you will reach top speed just at the corner.

<h3>Double Draft</h3>

This is just like a normal draft, but you draft one car, then overtake it 
to draft a second car. This is best done with the GTO and Supra. 
Depending on how those cars are going, either could be leading. 
<p>
Hopefully the lead car will be well in front of the other car. How far is 
ideal depends on your speed and timing, but you should draft the first 
car a bit earlier than you would for a single draft, then pull in behind 
the second car with time to get around it before the end of the straight.
<p>
Take care going around the first car and getting in behing the second. 
It is very easy to get out of shape and even crash (yes, Ive done that!)
<p>
With some luck, practice, the right car (either the Supra or GTO) and gear ratios you can do 300mph. But for any car it should increase its top speed 
by a decent amount. And well, its damn fun.
<p>
So get out there and get some <b>SPEED!!!</b>
