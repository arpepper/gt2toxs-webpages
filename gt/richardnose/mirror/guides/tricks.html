<h2>Some Neat Tricks</h2>

While there is not much in the way of cheats in Gran Turismo, there are a 
few "features" that are quite handy. These can save you a few dollars 
and a few car spots in the garage.
<p>
If you know of any more tricks you want to share, please email me 
and I will include them here.

<h3>Parts Sharing</h3>

You can share parts between cars of the same model. The cars must be from 
the same place (ie both bought new or 2nd hand or both won) not just 
similar (a Supra RZ from the Normal Series is not the same as a bought 
Supra RZ).
<p>
If you have bought parts for one of these cars, then the other car can use 
the parts by simply going into a race and using Change Parts to select 
the parts.
<p>
This only works for parts, not modifications such as port grind, weight 
reduction or race kit.
<p>
See <a href="mods.html">Guide to the Tuneup Shop - Sharing Parts</a> 
for more details.
<h3>Colour Swapping</h3>

You can swap the colour of your car - very cool to be able to do it with 
your race colour schemes. This can save you having to buy two special models 
or keep 2 of each race car. It will also work with race cars you win.
<p>
So this can save money and save space in your garage.
<p>
Here is how it works.
<p>
If you have a normal car, weight reduced and ready for a race body. You want 
the race body, but like both colours (or hate them equally!) and would like 
to be able to swap between them. You go:
<ol>
<li>Save Game - we will need to get back here later
<li>Buy a racebody - pick either colour
<li>Enter a race
<li>Save the settings - put the colour in the name for your own reference
<li>Exit back out
<li>Load Game - get back to where we started
<li>Buy a racebody - the other colour this time
<li>Enter a race - haven't we done this before?
<li>Save the settings - remember to put the colour in the name
<li>DONE
</ol>
Now you can now use either colour by simply loading the settings for that colour.
<p>
Same trick can be done with the Special Models, but just replace the "Buy Racebody" 
with "Buy Special Model"!
<p>
What about if you already have a car with a racebody? It can still be done, 
just that it works a bit different.
<ol>
<li>Save Game
<li>Buy another identical car (or win one!)
<li>Mod it up to race spec including the other colour kit
<li>Save the settings
</ol>
Then follow the same steps as above.
<p>
Doing it for race models that have been won works, but you must win 
the car first. Then it really only saves you garage space. I doubt many 
people would use it for that, since it is so hard to win all the colour 
combinations (anyone got the yellow + black taxi coloured Silvia LM???)
