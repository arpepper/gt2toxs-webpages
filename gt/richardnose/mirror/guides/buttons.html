<h2>Helpful Buttons</h2>

There are buttons in some menus that are quite useful, but aren't given in 
the documentation. None of these will unlock vast secrets or give you any 
magic bonuses. But they will save you some time (in some cases a lot of time). 
And the less time doing the boring bits, means more time doing the fun bits!
<p>
Some of these buttons are also listed in the manuals, but who has read all 
the fine print in the manuals.

<h3>My Button Codes</h3>

Since I can't draw the buttons, I'll need to use a few codes to describe 
the buttons.
<p>
The right hand console buttons (clockwise from top):
<ul>
<li>A - triangle
<li>O - circle
<li>X - cross
<li>[] - square
</ul>
<p>
The keypad (clockwise from top):
<ul>
<li>^ - up
<li>&gt; - right
<li>v - down 
<li>&lt; - left
</ul>
<p>
The back buttons:
<ul>
<li>L1 - L1 (top, left)
<li>L2 - L2 (bottom, left)
<li>R1 - R1 (top, right)
<li>R2 - R2 (bottom, right)
</ul>
<p>
A "+" will be used to indicate when two buttons need to be held together.

<h3>Show Me The Money</h3>

Winning lots of mulla after a race is great, but it can get a bit boring 
watching it click over to your bank account (especially the $300k for the 
Grand Valley 300). You can cancel this and just get the total dumped straight 
down. Less time counting, more time spending...
<p>
Wait till the money count is up and started and then hit:
<ul>
<li>A - dump money
</ul>

<h3>Fast Settings</h3>

For changing setting such as gear ratios and downforce, the normal left and 
right buttons change the value of the setting. Especially for gear ratios this 
can be quite slow. There are some buttons that can speed this up.
<p>
All of these can be held down and the settings will continue to change as 
long as they are held. But these work fast (especially the SuperFast!), so 
they won't need a lot of holding.
<p>
<h4>Fast Settings</h4>
<ul>
<li>L1 - decrease setting
<li>R1 - increase setting
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Super Fast Settings</h4>
There is also an even faster mode:
<ul>
<li>L1 + &lt; - decrease setting
<li>R1 + &gt; - increase setting
</ul>

<H3>Moving In Your Garage</H3>

You can also move up and down quickly in the garage. So instead of just hitting or holding 
the up and down buttons, you can jump several cars at a time.
<ul>
<li>L1 - move up
<li>R1 - move down
</ul>
<h3>Swap Between "Settings" and "Change Parts"</h3>

You can swap directly between these two menus, without going back to the 
main Setup Parts menu. These buttons work when you are in one of the two 
menus and want to go to the other menu. You can't be inside one of the 
sub-parts e.g. you can't be in the gear change option at the time.
<ul>
<li>R1 - goto Change Parts
<li>L1 - goto Settings
</ul>

<h3>Replay Options</h3>

Yes these are listed in the manual, but it seems a lot of people skip that 
part and don't know about this. They really make a replay a bit more 
interesting.
<p>
When doing a replay you can use a few buttons to change what is shown.
<ul>
<li>^ or v - swap between cars
<li>X or [] or O or A - toggle between inside, outside and with stats views.
<li>L1 - rear view (when on inside view)
</ul>

<h3>Time Trial Records</h3>

After doing a Time Trial, you can go and view the records for that track. 
Once in the records menu, it is possible to view the records for all tracks. 
<ul>
<li>&lt; - go to previous track
<li>&gt; - go to next track
</ul>
<p>
This makes it a lot easier to view all the records, rather than having 
to enter each race.
<p>
The same trick works in Arcade mode and in the License records.
