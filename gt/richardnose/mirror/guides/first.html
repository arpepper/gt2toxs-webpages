<h1>Your First Car</h1>


You have passed your B license and have $10,000 burning a hole in 
your virtual pocket. Hmm - a Viper would be nice!!!
<p>
Well $10k is not a lot of money, so you will need to buy 2nd hand. 
That Viper may just have to wait a little while...
<p>
A quick glance around will show that there is a number of cars available 
from several manufacturers (ignore TVR, Aston Martin, Dodge and Chev - they dont have 
2nd hand cars.) Most of the Japanese companies have a few cars available 
for under 10k.
<p>
Ive assumed that you have passed your B test and are ready to race. If you 
havent then do so now. If you are having trouble then it may be worth while 
spending a bit of time on arcade mode. Its easier than simulation mode, but 
will give you some good experience.<br>
If you have been on arcade and are still having some trouble with the B test 
you can still buy a car. You will be limited to spot races until you get 
the license.
<p>
Ok, its time to pick your first car...

<h3>Before you buy</h3>

Before you buy, there are a few things you should know about the dealerships.
<P>
The Used Car lots are the place to buy and sell. The Tune-Up shop lets you
buy extra parts. These are the places you will be visiting to start with.
Yes go kick tyres on the new cars, but forget owning one for a little while.
<P>
When you sell, you wont get back as much as you paid for the car. You wont 
get anything for parts you added in the tune-up shop. So once you put serious 
money into a car, its best to keep that car (your garage can hold 100 cars, 
that will take a while to fill).
<P>
If you win a car (when you win a series), often its a good idea to sell it. 
When you come to selling it, the price is fixed and the best price will be 
from the manufacturer of the car. So dont waste time shopping around, just 
go and get your $12,000 for it.
<P>
The used car lot changes about every 10 game days (the days are shown in the
bottom left). So check them out when you first start. If you have a car you want
badly but cant afford because its just over 10k, then wait a few days and look
again, a cheaper one may have come in. Other cars come and go, so they wont always be listed.<br>
How do you wait a few days? Well your B license will take at least 8 days and
Id guess quite a few more than that!
<P>
Go to the tune-up shop and have a look around. Read the 
<a href="mods.html">Guide to the Tuneup Shop</a> 
to get an idea of what is a good way to modify your car.

<h3>So what is the best first car?</h3>

There is no definite answer. There are several major types to choose from, 
your pick depends on how good a driver you are, what you want to do with the car 
and naturally your own personal preferences.<br>
Im just giving some guidelines here, so you know what the differences are 
between the cars. The final choice is yours, but thats one of the good things 
about GT, there are so many cars to pick from.
<p>
Any of the cars you can buy for $10k are going to be a bit slow. Many are 
good to learn on, some are even good to tune up to full race cars. But dont 
worry too much if its a bit slow, you can always sell it later and get other cars.<br>
However, a good first choice will give you confidence, money and heaps of fun.
<p>
The 3 main styles are cars are described by the driven wheels, that is which
wheels are driven (connected) to the engine. These are described by the same 
code as in arcade mode.
<p>
The possibilities are:
<ul>
<li>Rear (FR or MR) - The F means front engine, M mean mid (technically between 
the axles of the car). The rear wheels only have power.<br>
There are no MR cars for under 10k, so we can ignore them for now.<br>
I will split rear wheel drive into turbo and non-turbo, since these tends to 
be quite different.
<li>4wd - these are all front mounted engines. All 4 wheels have power (often 
referred to as "awd" - all wheel drive, when the cars are designed for roads 
rather than off-road). Although these are nearly all turbo engines, to make full use 
of the extra traction of 4wd, unfortunately the only one under 10k is non-turbo.
<li>Front Wheel (FF) - Again the first F means front engine, all front wheel 
drive cars in the game are front engine. Typically normally aspirated, a few of 
them take turbo upgrades, but these are never outrageous turbos and behave similar to 
the non-turbo cars.
</ul>

<h3>Which type of car should I get?</h3>

This is the major decision. The style used to drive each type is quite 
different. For each type give a rough idea of the style. It will change from car to
car, but it will give a rough idea of the differences.
<p>
Recommended examples will be listed, generally from best to worst 
(or at least not so good). Dont be afraid to try something 
other than the top of the list. Often its a balance between power and weight, 
so pick what suits you.<br>
For example, the Prelude is listed 4th in the FF group, 
but many people will swear by it as the best choice. So read the comments and 
have a look at the cars stats to compare them.
<P>
There is a lot more to this game than your first car. So maybe at this point 
you should already be thinking about your next car. This can make a difference 
to what you select. The main reason to this is that there are race series 
restricted to each drive type and one for lightweight. So you will need to 
own at least 1 each of FF, FR and 4wd. Ideally one of these will also a 
lightweight car.
<P>
My preference is probably to go with a lightweight car first. Then use this 
to win the Sunday Cup as well as the lightweight series and the FF (assuming 
its FF). That way I have used the same car to win 3 series and should have 
plenty of money. To help with that Ive indicated which cars in my examples are eligible 
for the lightweight series. Often these are at the top of my suggestions lists, 
which may reflect a bit on my preference towards these types of cars. 
<P>
Dont panic too much if you dont pick a lightweight, you can buy one later, 
or use the Demio you will win in the Sunday Cup. Anyway, look at 
<a href="whichcar.html">Which Car For Which Race Series</a> 
to get an idea of what cars to use later in other race series.

<h4>Front Wheel Drive</h4>
A front wheel drive car is probably a good first choice. Not the greatest cars 
but you cant go too badly wrong with them and its a good way to learn GT. 
<p>
These tend to be fairly easy to drive. In general they are light cars and handle well.<br>
Performance is ok. They will hold their own in the first races. Lack of power 
means that they must be driven smoothly, its hard to gain speed after a mistake. <br>
Potential is limited. These will never be tyre smoking machines. Most will be fully 
tuned at around 200-300hp. A few take turbos, but even then they tend to allow 
only smaller turbo kits.<br>
Style is a bit poor. They do suffer from a "shopping trolley" image. But dont 
let that put you off. Tuned up and driven well some of these cars will compete against 
and beat 400hp supercars.<br>
<p>
Good examples include:
<ul>
<li>Mirage Cyborg - (lightweight) very light, but with good power. Is capable of winning several race 
series, including Sunday Cup, Clubman, FF and Lightweight. With luck and good driving 
can even win the GT Cup.
<li>Honda Civic - (lightweight) another small wonder.
<li>Honda CRX - (lightweight) similar to the Civic. Get the Sir version.
<li>Honda Prelude - bigger, heavier and more powerful. Goes really well, handles well 
but doesnt have the throwable feel of the smaller cars. Get the Vtec version.
<li>
</ul>
<h4>4 Wheel Drive</h4>
4wd are great to drive and can handle huge amounts of power without some of 
the tail-happy problems of rear wheel drive cars. Unfortunately they are also expensive, which means that there is not much of 
a selection even on the 2nd hand market. In fact there is only one available:
<ul>
<li>GTO 92 - heavy but powerful, its a non-turbo
</ul>
Its not hard to drive, but the GTO is very heavy, which means you need to take it easy.
This excess weight also limits performance, but good power helps.
Better at high speed than on tight courses.<br>
Potential is not so good, it is non-turbo, so it will never have the huge 
performance of its turbo sisters<br>

<h4>Turbo Rear Wheel Drive</h4>

Turbo power and rear wheel drive, a great combination, this can make for a 
seriously fast car. If driven well they can be very rewarding.
<p>
They are not that easy to drive and take a bit to learn. They get harder as they 
get more powerful. Handling can be twitchy and careful use of the pedals is needed.<br>
Performance is their strong point, top speed and straight line acceleration are the main weapons.<br>
Plenty of potential, but you need to be able to handle it. Even some of the cheapies 
can end up with 400 or more HP.<br>
They ooze style, hard to beat a tail out drift through a corner for style points. 
Even if you do spin, a smoking burn-out is fun!
<p>
Good examples include:
<ul>
<li>Toyota Supra - the old model, but has the most power for under 10k
<li>Toyota RX7 (GTX or III) - both are powerful but still fairly light.
<li>Nissan Silvia K - nice balance of power and weight
</ul>

<h4>Non-Turbo Rear Wheel Drive</h4>

These tend to be much easier to drive than turbo rear wheel cars. Some come as 
lightweight sports cars rather than bloated tanks. Better to aim for a dedicated 
non-turbo rather than than a car that has a turbo version.
<p>
While there are many great non-turbo rear wheel cars in the game, unfortunately 
most of them are not Japanese and so are not available to start with. But if 
you dream of a Viper, then maybe this is the place to find your baby viper!
<p>
Generally easier to drive than turbos, lightweight ones handle well, without the 
excessive power the rear will be much more stable. Some of the more powerful ones
can be a handful, but these are usually not available cheaply (not a worry for a 
first car)<br>
Performance is not up to turbos, but the dedicated non-turbo cars can be quite good, similar to front 
wheel performance.<br>
Potential is often limited, these will rarely trouble the turbo cars when both are 
fully tuned.
<p>
Good examples include:
<ul>
<li>Nissan GTS25 - powerful for a non-turbo and not too heavy
<li>Toyota Levin/Sprinter (lightweight) - again under powered, but more power and less
weight than the Mazda. Down on style but ok on performance.
<li>Mazda Roadster (lightweight) - under powered compared to others, but has great feel.
<li> Nissan Silvia Q - has a turbo version, which is much better.
</ul>



<h3>Summary</h3>

Ok, the cheats come straight here.
<p>
Most beginners prefer front wheel drive.<br>
Get a turbo rear wheel car if you are brave and want an instant rush!<br>
Get a light, but reasonably powerful car<br>
A good first choice is one of:
<ul>
<li>Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg (its eligible for the lightweight series)
<li>Honda Prelude (vtec if possible)
<li>Toyota Supra (most power for under 10k - if you are brave!)
<li>Mazda RX7
</ul>
<p>
What ever car you get, learn to drive it. Hang on to it, you will come back 
later and look fondly on your first car. It may also be fun, when you are a 
more experienced driver, to see just how far you can take that car!
<p>
Good luck and have fun!
