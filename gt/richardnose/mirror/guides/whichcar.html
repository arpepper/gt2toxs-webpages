<h2>Which Car For Which Race Series</h2>

In general there are many cars capable of winning any given race series. 
Naturally the easier series (Sunday Cup, Clubman) can be won by just about 
every car, especially with some tuning mods. But some race series are a bit 
trickier and the right car is almost essential.
<p>
This guide is by no means the definitive list of cars capable of winning a series. 
It will mention the main cars, but if you feel like a challenge try a different car. 
Often good driving and some luck will get what seems like a hopelessly out classed 
car to win a few races and maybe even a series.<br>
As they say, winning is not everything - sometimes a hard earned 2nd can be far 
more rewarding than an easy victory.
<p>
I'll list the race series by license, so all the B ones come before any A or AI.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This guide assumes you are playing the <B>PAL</b> 
version of GT. The cars are different between that and the US 
and Japanese versions. In general any cars recommended here will 
work well in those versions. However the reverse is not true. 
The main example is the race Concept Car, which is about the 
best car in the US version, is very average in the PAL version.
<p>
<h3>Sunday Cup (B license)</h3>
Anything. In fact most cars can win this without any mods.
<P>
This is about the only race series that can be won without any mods!
<p>
Pick a car you want to use to win some other series.

<h3>FF Series (B)</h3>

This is an easy series, none of the computer cars are race modified.
<P>
Your car will need some tuning for power, suspension and some tyres.
<P>
Good choices are:
<ul>
<li>FTO GP-R - the best of the FF cars. Expensive and will 
<li>Prelude - even a 2nd hand under 10k Sir will do well with some tuning.
<li>Mirage - light and reasonable power, available as a 1st car.
<li>Starlet - for a change, this little Toyota is quite a hoot!
</ul>
<h3>FR Series (B)</h3>

Another easy series against non-race cars, more power, tyres and suspension
will get a win here. Most of the choice cars will do it easily.
<p>
Good choices are:
<ul>
<li>Supra RZ - turbo power. Doesn't even need full power to win.
<li>RX7 - another turbo car. Use a new one or a 2nd hand one.
<li>Silvia - a sweet little car, go with the K (turbo) model.
<li>Corolla Sprinter - will need a lot of work, but can do it!
</ul>
 
<h3>4WD Series (B)</h3>

Fewer choices with 4wd, but some nice cars to pick from.
<p>
Good choices are:
<ul>
<li>Nissan GTR - don't use full tune, it's just not fair!
<li>GTO - another power monster but it's heavy.
<li>Impreza - probably the choice of the rally cars. Power is ok, but it's
the great handling that makes it so easy to drive.
<li>Lancer - another rally car, take your pick of it or the WRX on personal
taste.
<li>Pulsar Gti - lightest of the 4wd but can do it. Down on power to the other 
rally cars.
</ul>

<h3>LightWeight Series (B)</h3>

Dominated by front wheel drive, this is a tough series. 
Most cars will need to be around full spec to have a chance. You can't 
just waltz in with a stock car and win this series.
<p>
Hint - keeping speed up is the key here, as most cars are down a bit on power.
<p>
Good choices are:
<ul>
<li>FTO GP-R - the best of the FF cars is the best here.
<li>Mirage - especially if you choose to get this as your 1st car
<li>Demio - lightest car but down on power.
<li>Corolla Sprinter - rear wheel drive gives it a nice feel.
</ul>


<h3>The Big Three</h3>
Sounds like a cheesy western...
<p>
But before we go any further, I think I should mention these 3 cars, 
since they will dominate most race series.
<p>
The big three are normal cars you can buy, that when fully tuned are capable 
of beating anything that GT will throw at you. These cars are almost too good! 
All are over 900HP fully tuned. These are the ultimate speed machines...
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nissan GTR - the king of power. The Vspec version is the most powerful car 
in GT at 941HP, with the non-vspec only 937HP. Even a R32 will get over 900 ponies.<br>
4WD gets this power down, but a heavy car, narrow tyres and poor downforce 
limit the car. Still its limit is way above most other cars.
<li>Supra RZ - the king of rear wheel cars. Faster top speed than the Nissan, 
it loves to flow along fast sweepers. Can be twitchy with rear wheel drive, but 
with power to blow any race series away.
<li>GTO - another 4wd, it is heavy. The king of top speed, it can run over 430kph 
on the test track. An extra gear gives it an advantage on the GTR.
</ul>
<p>
When tuned, these cars can win any race they are eligible to enter. Pick your 
weapon off the style you like.
<p>
So from now on, it will be assumed that these cars are covered when I say "the big three".

<h3>Clubman Cup (A license)</h3>

Pretty easy, non-race cars with mild tuning. Pick just about anything.
<p>
For a bit of a challenge try a lightweight car - a Demio or Mirage.


<h3>US v Japan (A)</h3>

Some quite good race cars make these country challenges the first real tough test in GT.
<p>
The Big Three, being Japanese will do well here. Many other cars can do the job, especially 
the race cars you win during these series.
<p>
The Japanese cars will dominate this and the Jap v UK series.
<h3>Japan v UK (A)</h3>
Another series for the Big Three.
<p>
For a change try a TVR, but forget the Aston Martins!
<h3>US v UK (A)</h3>
Oh no - no Big Three!
<p>
This can be a scare for people who have got this far by using the same Japanese car for everything else. 
This may be their first go with another car and possibly with a FR car, as that is what the US and UK do. 
<p>
Dodge and TVR are best, but a Chev can do if needed.
<p>
Try:
<ul>
<li>Viper GTS - from Jap v US series. Big and grunty, this has the most power in this series.
<li>Viper RT/10 - but it will need plenty of tuning.
<li>Griffith - either model, 
<li>Cerbera LM - which is won in this series, but nice to use to win a 2nd time.
</ul>

<h3>MegaSpeed (A)</h3>

Even though its an A license series, the computer cars are all non-race cars.
<P>
Anything with over 500HP should do ok. However the Big Three will do it easily! 
The computer will often have a GTO with 900HP, but consistent results in all 
3 races should get you home.
<p>
A race body helps (reduce downforce for the Test Track) and a race gearbox 
is important, since the High Speed Ring is not that fast compared to the 
Test Track (shouldn't it be called the Not Quite So High Speed Ring?). 
Change the gear ratios, or at least the final drive, to suit the tracks. <br>
See <a href="gear.html">Setting Gear Ratios</a> 
for advice that will help.

<h3>Normal Race (A)</h3>

The normal race series is one of the hardest to win. It definitely is the one 
that has the least number of cars capable of winning.
<p>
It's for stock, showroom cars. No mods at all, not even tyres. You can enter a 
car that has bought parts, as long as they are swapped off before entering 
the race series. See <a href="mods.html">Guide to the Tuneup Shop</a>
for details on permanent parts that make a car ineligible for this series.
<p>
Before giving the usual list, I should point out that the Viper is supreme here, 
the rest of the list is really just for those who want to push themselves.
<ul>
<li>Viper - either model will win and do so easily. This is the best normal car 
in the game, with the most power and huge grip. This is by far the weapon of choice.
<li>Supra - can do it, but you will work hard.
<li>NSX - if its good enough for the computer... Hard to learn, with twitchy
MR handling, but fast.
<li>Griffith - can be done, but will be a real challenge
</ul>

<h3>Grand Valley 300 (AI)</h3>

A long hard race, this will take over an hour and a half. If you can do it 
quicker than that, then you dont need any advice!
<p>
Race cars, a tough track and a long time at the wheel means you need a car 
that is easy to drive, but fast. For your first few attempts it is best to lean towards easy to drive rather than 
blinding speed.
<p>
Drive conservatively on cold (blue) tyres and plan for either 3 or 4 tyre stops 
(that's every 15 or 12 laps respectively).
<p>Dont forget to smile for the replay!
<ul>
<li>Impreza Rally - the expensive special is great here. About the fastest car 
and close to the easiest to drive.
<li>FTO LM - win this car (US v Jap) and it will do well here. Another easy to 
drive car, but with speed to get you laps ahead at the end.
</ul>
Any other number of cars can win this race - GTR, GTO, Supra, RX7, NSX.<br>
But these will be much harder and are not advisable unless you have full 
control over the car.
