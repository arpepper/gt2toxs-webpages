<h1>Gran Turismo Versions</h1>


Gran Turismo has several versions for different markets.<br>
The three versions (in order of their release) are:
<ul>
<li>Japanese
<li>US
<li>PAL
</ul>

The versions differ a reasonable amount, with things such as 
language, tv systems, units of measure and even stats of some cars 
(although it seems to be mainly the weight of the cars, not the power 
or other stats.) 
The license test differ, with the time required to pass changing. 
However the Gold times seem to be the same.
<p>
The basic game play is the same. The same race series are available.

<h3>Summary</h3>
The PAL version misses out on a very fast car - the prize Concept Car. 
In the US and Japanese versions, this is a pocket rocket, the amazingly 
low weight giving it great power to weight, fantastic braking and 
superb handling. The Japanese version also gets a similar weight Cerbera LM, 
but with just a bit more power!
<p>
Many of the cars in the PAL version are heavier, right through from 
the supposedly lightweight Demios to the TVRs.
<p>
So PAL players should not worry if they can't seem to match times posted 
for the Concept Car - a 50% weight penalty makes a huge difference.
<p>
The Japanese version has the lightest cars, with a few powerful cars 
such as the Cerbera LM and Viper GTS coming in lighter than their US versions.
<p>
In the end, it does not matter. GT is still the best!
