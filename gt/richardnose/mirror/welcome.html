<FONT SIZE="+2">Hi... I'm DickNose.</FONT><p>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Welcome to my Gran Turismo Site!<p>
This site is dedicated to Gran Turismo - the best driving games ever!<p>
<b>
</FONT></center>
<p>This site contains many detailed lists of cars and race series from GT2. The guides and lists found here are mine, not copied off anyone else. So hopefully they will give a different perspective on a few things. Some of them will be for beginners, some for advanced drivers, but all should be informative.<p>
This may not be the prettiest site on the web, but it should be fairly informative (hey - Im an engineer, not an artist).<p>
My car and track lists contain info that is usually not found on other lists. They will also be cross referenced, so you can jump between the cars and the events easily.<br>
They are based off the PAL version of the game, so there may be differences with the Japanese and North American versions.
<p>
If you have any comments on them, corrections, suggestions, flames or abuse - 
just <a HREF="MAILTO:dax@ihug.com.au">email me</a> and I'll see what you have to say.

I got an award for GT driving (yes GT1...) So all those hours of playing and doing 
Time Trials paid off!<br>
Thanks to Squib for the award and for the effort that he puts into his site.
