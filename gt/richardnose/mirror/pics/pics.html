<h1>Pics</h1>
Well I've got some pictures of REAL cars from GT.<br>
So what you say?<br>
The exciting bit is that they had the Dodge Concept Car at the Sydney International Motor Show - so I've seen GT's best car in the flesh, lucky for you I've got some photos.
<p>
A special thanks to Gus for taking them on his digital camera (ie his new toy!). Thanks also to Brad ("don't call me the pirate king") and Jeff ("I drive a bus, why arent they in GT") for coming along and putting up with me while I drooled over GT cars and some killer motorbikes!
<p>
<b>Be warned</b> - my sad dial (and other bits) are in some of these.
