Actually, I used Full-customization transmission, at the default
settings it provides (auto-set 13).  Gets rid of the "overdrive"
effect of the default.  Seems to help with super-soft tires, but
may actually hurt with soft tires.

For practice I did a 50-lap Enduro at Midfield with soft tires.
Pretty good, but no GT40 showed up and a couple of the Ai cars
frequently got stuck as they entered the pits.
