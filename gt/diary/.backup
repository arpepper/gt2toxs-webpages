I have now moved the diary pages to a similar, but different,
URL; just change <b>/gt/</b> which gets you here, to <b>/gt2/</b>.
You must look for them there manually; I am avoiding creating any
direct hypertext links there.
</p>
<p>
It is still the case that the diary pages may soon disappear totally, with
little or no notice.  (Other than this).
<p>
<p>
These pages began as an experiment to help me explore some ideas regarding
using HTML, and, specifically, converting naturalish text documents into
reasonable HTMl, and linking those pages together in various appropriate
ways.  Quite clearly, the rate at which I am learning anything by creating
these pages has diminished a lot.  Or, in other words, they have probably
got out-of-hand.
</p>
There is a very slim chance that I would actually manage to go to the
effort and expense of having these pages hosted professionally somewhere.
