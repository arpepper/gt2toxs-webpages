Gran Turismo 2: Complete Car List & Info Database
Version 2.2--19 November 2000
Compiled by Dave Connoy

| Preface |
+---------+
Like my Complete Car List for the original Gran Turismo, this document is
simply a list of all cars available in the North American version of Gran
Turismo 2.  Dealer figures on horsepower continue to be inaccurate (even more
so than in GT), myths on what cars are/are not in the game, and confusion
about the capabilities of those cars, seem to be running rampant and I think
this endeavor should facilitate discussion.

Since this list is in a tabular format, nothing except a single-width font
(such as Courier New) will suffice for displaying it in editors like WordPad.
The latest version of this list can always be found at www.gamefaqs.com, by
far the recommended source for video game FAQs and guides on the Web.

I've created a Microsoft Excel version of this list, which is available at
private.addcom.de/bradley/gt2.  It's up to date with version 2.0 of the text
FAQ.

Version 2.2: Where have I been?  Playing GT2.  Not over-anaylzing and stat-
     crunching it, but *playing* it.  What a concept!  No new main list
     material, just revisions to the Best Cars lists and FAQ section.
Version 2.1: Just when I think I'm out... they PULL ME BACK IN!!!  Hidden car
     bonanza for this update--new section details how to get the original
     versions of the Hondas that were Acura-ified for the US version, and a
     Nissan that was left out.  HUGE thanks to RogsR34UK and his code-
     deciphering skillz for this info.  Also tuned up a few things--who knew
     there were two different cars called "240SX Fastback Type X '96"?
Version 2.0: Front Mission 3 fell through, so I figured I might as well
     complete *something*.  ALL the car data is here now, the DexDrive save
     and Excel spreadsheet have a home, and a new statistical best/worst
     section is added.  Done!  See you come GT2K.
Version 1.5: More car data added, and some text revisions made.  Added
     another question to the FAQ section.  2000's game release schedule is
     pretty dense, and I'm moving on to write a FAQ for Front Mission 3, so
     this document will most probably not see any more updates.  It's been a
     fun ride, and thanks to all who helped.
Version 1.4: Data added for most of the Nissan Skylines, and a Frequently
     Asked Questions section added.  Further update to the status of the save
     file associated with this document in the "Hidden Cars" section.  Excel
     version is still in limbo; status is in the Preface.
Version 1.3: Dumbass that I am, I didn't include the GameShark code or data
     for the Honda Integra Type R 98 spec, so that's been added.  A few other
     touch-ups here and there.
Version 1.2: Added a little text to "Mysteries of the GT40".  DexDrive save
     has been uploaded to www.gameshark.com.  Got in about six hours of
     actual racing, so "GT2's Best Cars" lists now reflect a little more
     real-game experience.  Honda, Mitsubishi, and Subaru now 100% complete.
Version 1.1: Small update.  Corrected name of STP Viper GT; added new lists
     to "GT2's Best Cars" section (let the flame wars commence); added new
     details on [R]CLK Race Car GameShark code; added babble on GT40.
Version 1.0: Huge update.  Subaru now complete save stragglers.  All prize
     cars (including those from Endurance races) are complete.  Added hidden
     cars to list and new "Hidden Cars" section to explain how to get them.
     Reorganized lists to follow a stricter ordering scheme.  Since all cars
     are now listed, even if without statistics, we've hit version 1.0.
Version 0.7: Honda, Mazda, and Mitsubishi complete except for a few
     stragglers.  Added Prize Car Listing and a section on GT2's best cars.
Version 0.5: Added entries for all Hondas and a lot of other missing cars.
     Put in the (very incomplete) missing manufacturers.
Version 0.4: First published version.  Still a work in progress; everything
     except Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota about 90% done.


+-----------------------+
| Introduction/Notation |
+-----------------------+
Here I'll explain the notations used in the list.

Name: The first column contains the car's name, prefixed with a "*" if it is
a prize car (obtained by winning a particular event) and/or an "[R]" for full
race cars.  Finally, Japan-only models are suffixed with (J).  Car names are
the ones used by the garage listing in the US version, typos and duplicates
included.

Several entries have a "!" before them.  These cars are not normally
accessible in the game.  See the "Hidden Cars" section at the end of the FAQ
for ways of obtaining them.

Yr: This column notes the model year of the car.  It may seem unneccessary,
but a few cars have identical names and the model year is the easiest way to
tell them apart.

DrvTrn: This column notes the car's drivetrain (using the conventions in the
Gran Turismo 2 manual).

A: The aspiration of the car's unmodified engine.  "N" represents normal
aspiration, and "T" represents turbo.  This isn't a terribly useful fact
since most cars are best driven highly tuned, but I thought it mentionable.

Tuned MinHP: The minimum peak HP achievable after the car has been fully
tuned.  Essentially, this is the car's stock peak HP after all permanent
engine modifications (engine balancing, displacement increase, and port
polishing) but without any other modifications.  This statistic is important
to know because it dictates what races the car is eligible for *after* full
tuning.

NA MaxHP: This is the peak HP after all highest-spec normal aspiration
parts installed.  Cars with stock turbocharging will not have this figure.

Turbo MaxHP: The peak HP after all highest-spec turbo aspiration parts
installed.  Normally-aspirated cars that cannot take aftermarket turbo
modifications will not show this figure.

Tuned Wt.: The car's weight after all three stages of weight reduction.

Racing Wt.: The car's weight with racing modification fitted.

Why no stock figures?  Since there is no "Normal" race in GT2, every car is
best tuned, and the minimum tuned HP is good to know for race eligibility.
The stock HP is generally about 5% below the minimum tuned HP, and dealer
figures on weight are always accurate.

Miscellaneous useful information about a car will occur indented on the line
below its entry.

drivetrain.  All statistics refer to full tune, with all highest-spec HP
increases and all three levels of weight reduction performed.

| Frequently Asked Questions |
+----------------------------+
I wanted to leave this as the domain of other GT2 FAQs, but I guess their
coverage is lacking because I keep getting these same questions from readers
via e-mail.  Hopefully this will help.

Update for Version 2.2: I've let the car list portion of this document be
added as a companion to the "Ultimate GT2 Information Database", at the
www.granturismo.com forums.  If you see a question that I haven't answered
here, try checking it at http://ubb.granturismo.com/Forum16/HTML/005826.html.

How do I get the Datsun 240Z/Impreza 22B/'68 2000GT/etc...?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Several of the used cars in the game are extremely rare and only show up in
their respective dealer's used car lots very infrequently.  They *are*
available, and not myths or mirages.  The selections of the used car lots
change (in a pre-scripted fashion) every 10 game days (on day 10, day 20, day
30, etc.) so that's how often you should check to see if what you're looking
for has come up.  To the best of my knowledge, these are the used cars that
could qualify as rare and will take some patience to find (some more than
others).  I've included the pair of four-character tags to get these cars
using the GameShark codes in the "Hidden Cars" section.

Mazda AZ-1 A spec '91 (B2D8, 0B0C)
Mazda RX-7 GT-Turbo '83 (30D8, 0B0C)
Mazda RX-7 RS-R '97 (C718, 0B0D)
Mazda RX-7 Type RZ '97 (C918, 0B0D)
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V RS '98 (C198, 170D)
Datsun 240Z 240ZG HS30 '71 (5918, 180C)
Nissan Skyline GT-R KPGC10 '71 (8098, 180C)
Nissan Skyline 2000 RS-X DR30 '84 (4058, 180C)
Nissan Skyline GTS-R R31 '87 (4098, 180C)
Nissan Skyline 280 Type MR (9058, 180C)
Nissan Skyline GT-R NISMO R32 '90 (40D8, 1860)
Subaru 360 (41D8, 1D0C)
Subaru Impreza 22B STi Version '98 (30D8, 1D0C)
Toyota 2000GT GT '68 (3498, 1E0C)
Toyota Celica '84 (2898, 1E0E)

A few of these are available very early in the game cycle, so you may want to
try creating a second save at the beginning of Simulation Mode, buying them
there, and trading them over to your "real" game save.

Finally, if you have a DexDrive, there are many game saves out there for
download that probably have one or more of these cars.  I'll put saves up at
www.gamefaqs.com and private.addcom.de/bradley/gt2 with these cars sometime
soon.

How do I get the game to award me a particular prize car?
---------------------------------------------------------
Many people playing GT2 would like to know what factors decide which prize
car you're awarded in a race that awards more than one (like GT World League
or the Endurance races).  Countless theories on what influences the prize car
award have been proposed, from the believable (the car you race, or your lead
in points) to the outlandish (how many times you pit stop in an endurance
race or even what laps you choose to pit stop on).

The truth of the matter is that prize cars are awarded completely at random.
"But I got the same car five times in a row!"  Well, when tossing a coin it's
entirely possible to get heads five times in a row.  You can change as many
variables as you want about the way you race and it won't influence GT2's
decision at all.  How do I know?  Using the GameShark, I raced GT World,
GT300, GT500, and all of the Endurance races under repeated identical
conditions--same car, same setup, same lead in points, etc., and I managed to
get all the cars awarded by the races without there being any difference in
any (controllable) variable from race to race.

So no, there is nothing I can tell you that will prevent you from getting
that Escort a third time instead of the GT90.  It's a stupid game mechanic--
Polyphony should have programmed the game to keep track of how many times
you've won a particular event to ensure a proper "rotation" of the car
awarded--but it's the way things work.  If you're fed up with it, like me,
then get a DexDrive or GameShark and cheat your way into the cars you don't
have.  Don't feel bad, you're entitled to them--GT2's awards system is silly.

I bought a car and it has more or less HP than the dealer said it did!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I've heard this complaint over and over and over again, and there is no good
explanation.  Two popular opinions:

1. It's intended to simulate real life--a dealer won't tell you the real
performance of a car, and if you want to find out for sure you have to test
it yourself.  Apparently, there are also restrictive automotive laws in Japan
that require that cars do not have a peak HP greater than 276 HP, which
dealers apparently sidestep by *claiming* that the car only pushes 276 in
brochures and the like, even though it does much more when tested.  So if a
car dealer will fudge the numbers to fool the government, it should come as
no surprise that they might do it to you.  A dodgy explanation indeed, but
it's the best one I've seen that doesn't call the phenomenon a bug.

2. It's a bug, yet another example of Polyphony's rushed programming of GT2.
I'm not sure about the validity of this since the same "bug" existed in the
original GT and Polyphony did not "fix" it for this release, but there sure
are bugs and glitches aplenty everywhere else in this game.

Regardless of the reason, the fact of the matter is that you can't trust the
dealer to give you the correct HP of a car, ever.  Accept it and move on, and
consult this list before any puchases so you know what you're getting into--
it's one of the reasons I put the work into creating it.

What are the differences between the Jpn/NA/Euro versions of GT2?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To create an exhaustive listing of these would be too time-consuming, but a
few important ones:

The GameShark codes I've included here do not work in the Jpn or Euro
versions of the game.  I don't have the time or inclination to track down
congruent codes for those versions, but if someone else would like to
contribute them, it would be much appreciated by the many readers that have
contacted me asking for them.

Engine power is in "ps" in the Jpn version, and HP in NA and Euro versions.
I don't know if any actual values were changed between versions or the units
simply converted.

Car weight is in pounds in the NA version and in kilograms in the Jpn and
Euro versions.  Again, I'm unsure if any actual values were changed or if the
relative weights of the cars stay the same.  One of the biggest differences
between the NA and Jpn/Euro versions of the original GT was a drastic change
in weight to some of the high-end cars.

Speed is in miles per hour (mph) in the NA version, and in kilometers per
hour (kph) in the Jpn and Euro versions.  Jay Rogers tells me this is
irritating to UK users as they use mph in real life. :)

All in all, the Euro version seems to be very, very similar to the Jpn
version, with few changes attempted--the Opel dealership became Vauxhall, and
some car names were changed to reflect import model designations (Daihatsu
Storia becomes Daihatsu Sirion, for instance), but not much else was done.

Update for Version 1.5: I've gotten e-mail from Euro version player Ron
Rangi, who tells me that the Euro version might have as few as 539 cars in
it.  Obviously, this means that quite a few got cut.  Which ones those are is
beyond the scope of this FAQ, but Jesse Katianda points out one somewhat
significant example in the Nissan Nismo GT-R LM Road Car R33.

Sony Computer Entertainment America, on the other hand, went wild attempting
to "localize" GT2 for the NA release, adding an Acura dealership to North
City to handle the Integra and NSX (which are sold under the Acura name in
the US), changing the names of some cars to reflect their US names (e.g.
Mazda Eunos Roadster became Mazda MX-5 Miata, and Mitsubishi GTO became
Mitsubishi 3000GT), changing model years to reflect lag in import car markets
(e.g. the Acura NSX and Toyota Supra), and changing measurement units in the
Car Settings screen from SI to English (resulting in some hilarious settings,
like ride heights of over ten feet).  There Honda cars obviated by the Acura
dealer are still in the code and can be driven, by the way--see the "Hidden
Cars" section for details.

If anyone has any informed commentary on differences between the various
regional versions of GT2, let me know.  Most notable would be any changes in
actual relative car performance (not just the units) in the highest-end cars.

What car am I supposed to use in Manufacturer Event X?
------------------------------------------------------
This is related to the question above--in the NA version, SCEA changed the
car names without updating the related manufacturer events to reflect the new
names.  Thus, there's a "Roadster" competition at Mazda and an "Alcyone"
event at Subaru, when neither of those cars seem to exist in the game.  To
find out what car you're supposed to be using for these events and any others
whose names confuse you, choose to see a preview of the race by clicking that
handy-dandy movie-projector icon, and see what cars the computer puts in.

What's a "hybrid"?
------------------
"Mr. P" from the GameFAQs GT2 message board explains hybrids thusly (and
better than I ever could):

"GT2 is structured in an object-oriented way, with each car in the car garage
having a listing for each modifiable part, each of which tells the game how
to affect an element of handling... Each car has different codes for
different parts, which is part of the grandeur of GT.  By hacking with a
GameShark, or related equipment, you can put parts from one car into another,
making a hybrid of the two.  And you can hybridize parts from many cars
together, too, pulling the best brakes from here and the best engine from
there, turbo boost... etc.  All this requires a GameShark, of course, or some
specific software for the DexDrive; if you have one of those, you can then
make experimental monsters in GT. :-)"

While this FAQ has some GameShark codes in it, they are only for accessing
complete cars already in the code--not for making hybrids.

Is the McLaren F1 in the game?
------------------------------
A few rumors have spread about the availability of the McLaren F1 in GT2.
The most common one states that you need to buy every single car in the game
in black, but there are a few other even more ridiculous ones as well.  This
rumor is completely unfounded, except for a few pieces of circumstantial
evidence, as its proponents have yet to provide a GameShark code, save file,
screenshot, statistics, or ANY other details, whatsoever, on the car.

Update for Version 2.1: RogsR34UK (rogsr34uk@dial.pipex.com) has catalogued
every inch of the GT2 car code and it ain't in there.  Period.  If you
encounter one (or any other car that's not in this FAQ), it's a hybrid.


+-----------------+
| GT2's Best Cars |
+-----------------+
As in my GT list, I'm including this section to highlight the real gems of
the game in various classes.  With 600 cars featured in GT2, finding the best
the game has to offer is an even bigger task (though some, like the Suzuki
Escudo, jump right out atcha).  Further, the huge number of cars makes it
more likely that two people won't agree on which could be called the best.


Best Bargain Cars
=================
Just like in the original GT, Simulation Mode sets you loose with only 10,000
credits, so unless you're studly enough to get all golds in a license test, a
trip to the used car lots in East City is required.  Some cars are affordable
in the sequel that were just out of reach in the original, so here's a new
list of picks for those who are just starting.

Honda Civic 3 Door Si '93
     This was a good starter car in GT, and retains that distinction in the
     sequel.  Its best assets are front-wheel drive and light weight.

Mazda RX-7 Infini III '90
     No big hyperbole surrounding this one, just a good FR car choice that's
     available early and not a Nissan.

Nissan Pulsar GTi-R '91
     Statistically this car is superior to the Celica, but a high center of
     gravity and narrow tires prevent it from living up to its pedigree.

Nissan Silvia K's 2000cc '91
     Less power than the Skyline, but also lighter.  Nissan says it's
     "probably the ideal car for beginners," but I'd favor a FF or 4WD.

Nissan Skyline GTS-t Type M R32 '91
     Nuff said.  Skyline fans will surely be locking on this one.  Nissan
     itself even touts it as "just the model to learn the basics of driving".

Toyota Celica GT-Four RC '91
     This has both high power and high weight, but the 4WD makes these
     attributes easier to handle.  More "sporty" than the Pulsar, too.


Best Stock Cars
===============
I had made this kind of list in my FAQ for the first GT, because there was a
"Normal" race that didn't allow any modifications or racing models.  No such
event is found in GT2, but I think it's interesting enough to note the new
supercars and tuner cars that kick butt right out of the box.

Lister Storm V12 (FR; 591HP, 3170lb)
     You just know when a manufacturer makes it into the game for only ONE
     car, it's gotta be good.  And is it ever--though a V12 engine in the
     front of a 3000-pound body sounds like a recipe for disaster, the Storm
     V12's ride is smooth and stable, thanks to race car-like downforce.

Nissan Mine's R34 Skyline GT-R (4WD; 618HP, 3395lb)
     I was originally only going to include this so Jpn car fans wouldn't cry
     foul, but it grew on me.  The numbers speak for themselves--this is the
     most powerful stock 4WD in the game--but the ride is a little jittery.

RUF CTR2 Sport (4WD; 529HP, 3020lb)
     All the 4WD RUFs are hardcore cars, but this is by far the pick of the
     litter.  Though it's not as fast, I prefer it to the Mine's R34 since it
     sticks to the road better.

Shelby Cobra 427 '67 (FR; 423HP, 2354lb)
     Shelby's signature roadster may have the aerodynamics of a streamlined
     house brick, but it sure is fun to drive.  It's best on the twisty
     tracks, since its top-end is held back by its 4-speed transmission.

TVR Cerbera 4.5 (FR; 428HP, 2425lb)
     The Cerbera continues to be one of the best stock cars available and has
     a real selling point in its price.  Not only is performance comparable
     to any of these, it's a steal at only 80,000 credits.

Wiegert Vector W8 Twin Turbo (MR; 634HP, 3417lb)
     Vector has gotten a lot of fans with its unique, space-age designs, and
     the W8 is a perfect example.  It's heavy, and the transmission's kinda
     weird, but the power of the twin-turbo V8 is unbeatable.


Best Road Cars
==============
I feel kind of redundant writing out this list since almost all of these are
the road versions of race cars or else barely street-legal, but a lot of the
fastest cars don't have an [R] in front of their names and definitely deserve
mention.  (I know the GT40 has one.  See "Mysteries of the GT40".)

Ford GT40
     Kicking it old school with this '65 model comes highly recommended.
     Handling is a little sloppy compared to current-model cars, but with
     some practice it can be turned into spectacular power-slides.

Jaguar XJ220 GT Race Car
     This car is a little heavy, but the peak power is astounding and it owns
     any course with a long straightaway.  Of course, racing modification
     only helps, and makes this car as dominant as the top-tier race cars.

Lotus Elise GT1
     The Elise GT1 suffers from the same nervous handling as the Esprit GT1.
     Stiffening the front springs will help keep it from getting away, and
     increasing downforce (with racing modification performed) helps too.
     With race mod this car is the equal of the best full-blown race cars.

Nissan R390 GT1 Road Car
     Great power, but held back by their sucky suspensions, which can never
     be upgraded, nor the settings changed.  Challenge yourself with one of
     these after you're bored with the XJ220 and GT-ONE.

Toyota GT-ONE Road Car '98
     Highest peak power in the game should draw anyone's attention to this
     one, and performance matches the statistics.  200+ mph is readily
     available with the stage 4 turbo, but the suspension has a little
     trouble handling that kind of punch from the engine.

TVR Speed 12
     Initially, simply opening the throttle will result in a spin 90% of the
     time.  To fix this ugliness, invest in a TCS Controller and jack that
     baby all the way to max.  It'll harm acceleration a bit, but I think
     "the most powerful road car ever built" has a little extra to spare. ;)


Best Rally Cars
===============
I've finally gotten around to trying out the rally mode with some
seriousness, and felt like making a list of what's worked out best for me.
The Cultus and Escudo have been moved here from the Best Race Cars list,
since this is the type of racing they were intended to do.

Daihatsu Storia Rally Car (4WD; 427HP, 1763lb)
     Daihatsu ain't good for much, but their rally car turned out pretty
     good.  It's disturbingly light, so prepare to be launched into the
     stratosphere by large jumps.  Sadly, it's hard to justify this car's $1M
     price when the superior Tigra is half that much.

Honda del Sol LM Edition (MR; 617HP, 1962lb)
     Pressing the del Sol LM into service as a rally car by softening the
     springs and raising the ride height results in a surprisingly effective
     weapon.  It needs a lighter touch than the 4WDs, but at its best it has
     turned in better times for me than anything save the Pikes Peak cars.

Opel Tigra Ice Race Car (4WD; 524HP, 2094lb)
     The best buyable rally car (the two degenerates below notwithstanding),
     and it's only 500K credits.  With it you'll be set for all the rally
     races except the hill climbs.  Perhaps the best value in all of GT2.

Suzuki Cultus Pikes Peak Version (4WD; 786HP, 1924lb)
     This can be used in road races, but it obviously belongs here.  Running
     this in any rally race except the hill climbs, or running it in any road
     race at all, will take all the challenge out of the game and is commonly
     considered cheating by GT2 fans.

Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version (4WD; 981HP, 1763lb)
     See above... times ten.  The Escudo is easily the best car in the game
     overall, but it's clear the hill climbs are the only events it was
     intended to do.  Use it, don't abuse it.

Toyota Celica Rally Car (4WD; 569HP, 2116lb)
     Not much to say about this one except that it's as good as it is hard to
     get.  Seems like too many of the best cars in this game are tucked away
     in license tests or endurace races.  (Will we see the Escudo and Cultus
     become rare prize cars in GT3, perhaps?)


Best Mid-HP Race Cars
=====================
GT300 Championship limits your car's HP to under 591, and there are quite a
few cool race cars that qualify.  While not the heaviest hitters, these cars
are fun to drive and will dominate GT300.  GT World League, GT500, and GT
All-Stars are also well within their capabilities.

Audi TT LM Edition (4WD; 544HP, 2138lb)
     Having seen the TT recommended a few times but not expecting much, I was
     blown away by its hellish the off-the-line kick and responsive steering
     even with the gas still pressed.  Granted, acceleration tapers off to
     average quickly, but it's made up for by amazing cornering at full bore.

Dodge Concept Car LM Edition (MR; 526HP, 1984lb)
     To say that the Concept Car LM has been... um... "castrated" since its
     complete dominance of the original GT would perhaps be a start.  Fatter,
     slower, and uglier, it's like the proverbial champ that got too lazy--
     but it still commands respect with its light weight and stable handling.

Honda S2000 GT1 (FR; 577HP, 2116lb)
     This new Honda creation not only looks menacing (especially in that
     elite "stealth black" color), it has the performance to back it up, with
     a better power-to-weight ratio than even the Viper race cars.  I like to
     stiffen the rear springs to get rid of that Supra-esque understeer.

Lotus Esprit GT1 (MR; 577HP, 1984lb)
     While it has as much or more potential than any of these entries, the
     Esprit's twitchy handling can make it a real handful.  So don't cane the
     nuts off it--straight line braking only, especially when dealing with a
     banked curve.

Mazda RX-7 LM Edition & RX-7 GT-C LM Edition (FR; 551/558HP, 2116lb)
     The crazy cool RX-7 returns, joined by the new RX-7 GT-C.  There are
     slight differences in handling between the two machines, but both
     deliver great acceleration at all speeds and pull out of corner drifts
     with authority.

Mitsubishi FTO LM Edition (4WD; 549HP, 2050lb)
     The FTO LM was renowned for its tameness in GT, and it continues to make
     the most of good-not-great performance by mating it with the most
     predictable, consistent handling in the game.  It's amazing how much not
     crashing every ten seconds can help your lap times. :)


Best High-HP Race Cars
======================
In GT, the best race cars were the best cars period, but in GT2 they're often
outclassed by full-tune road cars.  Still, these are well within the absolute
best the game has to offer and dwarf the other 99% of the cars in the game.
The go-to vehicles for GT World, GT500, and GT All-Stars.

Honda del Sol LM Edition (MR; 617HP, 1962lb)
     Still light, still nimble, still cute and adorable.  (I contend that
     this car is the most eligible for being made into a plush stuffed doll.)
     Raise the downforce to keep it from getting too uppity.

Nissan R390 GT1 LM Race Car '97 (MR; 633HP, 2204lb)
     The one I'm talking about here is the black version awarded in the Grand
     Valley Endurance--the blue '98 model from GT World League is merely okay
     (as high-power Le Mans race cars go:).  Pray the game doesn't reward
     your hour of hard work with the lame Impreza Rally Car instead... :/

Nissan Skyline GT-R GT '99 (4WD; 702HP, 2601lb)
     The race version of the Skyline comes in four different flavors and is
     the best way to get accustomed to high-HP LM racing, but it whispers
     "rookie" when over-relied upon.  Learn to race the MR cars as well to
     get the most out of GT2.

Toyota GT-ONE Race Car (MR; 672HP, 1984lb)
     This is either the '98 or '99 model; they're basically the same.
     Despite being rear-wheel drive, this one will rarely get out of hand and
     sticks to the road like glue.  The more I drive it, the more I love it.

TVR Cerbera LM Edition (FR; 624HP, 1962lb)
     Meet the new boss... same as the old boss.  The Cerbera LM continues to
     dole out spankings with the best of them, and with a hella cool new blue
     paint job to boot.  Too bad about having to do that freakin' endurance
     race to get it. :( More downforce helps this one too, by the way.

Venturi Atlantique 600 LM (MR; 705HP, 2116lb)
     I SWEAR I have not been paid off by the French.  Trust me--this is the
     most under-rated car in the game.  If you want a challenging car after
     growing bored with the Skyline, then throw down the cash.  Handling is a
     little hyper, but there are numerous remedies for that.


+-------------+
| Hidden Cars |
+-------------+
I'm normally not a GameShark user, but in the interest of making this list a
true clearinghouse of all GT2 car statistics, I'm including the normally
inaccessible [R]Mercedes-Benz CLK Race Car, Volkswagen Polo 1.4 16V, and
other cars that were removed for US release in the list, and adding this
section to help people acquire them.  These cars are in the game code but not
purchasable or winnable through normal means.  Allegedly the [R]CLK Race Car
had to be cut because of EA's fascist licensing policies (it appears in one
or more of the Need For Speed games, I'm told).  Why the ostensibly innocent
Polo didn't make it in is anyone's guess, and I figure the 300ZX thing was
just an oversight that occurred when the names were changed from Fairlady Z.
The Hondas were revised by SCEA for sale at the Acura dealer they added...

The Lost Hondas
===============
Why be interested in using the Hondas instead of their readily-available
Acura equivalents?  A few reasons:

All the Honda versions can take racing modification (only three of the nine
can in Acura form).

All the Honda versions have functioning Info screens (the "i" icon in the
garage and showroom view).  The Acuras offer naught but a buzzing noise to
those who are interested in commentary.

There are some cosmetic differences--the Acura versions of the Integra have
the American nose, with the two pairs of circular headlights, as opposed to
the Japanese Integra's more traditional bar-shaped configuration.

There are differences in performance between the Acura and Honda versions:
the Honda NSX Type R '92 is much lighter than its '93 Acura counterpart, and
the Honda Integra Type R 98 spec is much lighter than any Acura version of
the Integra, with no change in power.

Finally, for those purist Honda fans out there that regard SCEA's creation of
the Acura dealer as anathema, this should be right up your alley.

GameShark
=========
One way to get your hands on these cars is with the InterAct GameShark.
Previous versions of the FAQ had a code that would make the desired car show
up in a used car lot; RogsR34UK has pointed me to a superior code that lets
you buy any car from a new car showroom, thus letting you see all the
available colors and pick whichever you want.  The drawback, however, is that
you'll have to pay the standard price for the car (i.e., a cool million in
the case of the CLK).  But, I figure GameShark users won't have problems with
lack of funds... :)

In this chart are the first eight characters of the two lines:

NTSC Version 1.0    NTSC Version 1.1    NTSC Version 1.2
--------------------------------------------------------
801C3018            801C30D8            801C3328
801C301A            801C30DA            801C332A

The four-character tags on the first and second line follow this chart (or
the rare cars chart in the FAQ section):

Car Name                                1st Line  2nd Line
----------------------------------------------------------
Honda Integra SiR-G ('95)               8758      124D

Start the game with a code activated (they only work one at a time) and visit
the Toyota new car showroom.  The screen will look normal, but if you click
the first car in the list you'll see the car you identified in the code.  Buy
it in whatever color you want, then exit all the way out to the main menu and
save your game.  Restart *without* the code activated to race your new car
(the game will lock up if you try to enter an event with the code still
activated).  Keep in mind you'll still need to take the car to the
appropriate dealer to buy new tuning parts for it.

Experiences of readers attempting to use this code seems to indicate that
GameShark version 3.x is the minimum necessary.  The codes were originally
tested (and work perfectly) on my GameShark CDX version 3.3, but I've heard
from version 2.x users who couldn't get the codes to work.  Please, no more
mail on this subject--my inbox is already overflowing with "I can't get the
codes to work!" messages, and my GameShark experience is simply too limited
to solve everyone's problems.

Finally, those that are interested can find codes to "edit" the other slots
in the Toyota showroom (to buy multiple cars without having to restart), as
well as four-character tags for every car in the game (so you can use this
trick to get that prize car or rare car that's eluding you, or look at some
of the weird stuff I talk about later) at www.rogs.dial.pipex.com.

DexDrive
========
[Previous version's venomous rants about various websites deleted.  I think
enough people have seen them; they'd just be taking up space at this point.]

Update for Version 2.0: FINALLY someone has come forward with some web space
to host the save file.  It can now be found on the web at Bradley's GT2 site,
private.addcom.de/bradley/gt2.  If you have any problems downloading or using
the file, then let Bradley know.  Any compliments on the useful contents of
the file, can, of course, be directed to me. :)

Update for Version 2.1: I'll assemble a save with all the hidden cars, as
well as a few other hard-to-get cars, and upload it to Bradley's site and
GameFAQs (now that the latter is hosting DexDrive saves).

I hope access to these cars (especially the [R]CLK Race Car, which has been
asked about since GT2's release) helps everyone enjoy GT2 more.

Use The [R]Alfa Romeo 155 Touring Car or [R]Opel Calibra Touring Car
====================================================================
If you don't have either of these periperhals, the closest things to the
[R]CLK Race Car are the [R]Alfa Romeo 155 Touring Car and [R]Opel Calibra
Touring Car.  They have the same high-revving engine, power and torque
curves, suspension and LSD settings, gear ratios, and weight.  So buy one and
just pretend--the only thing you'll be missing is the CLK's better braking
ability.

| Final Rants |
+-------------+
As much as it bugs me when I see this kind of stuff in FAQs, I'm going to
editorialize for a moment here.  However, unlike certain blowhard FAQ
authors, I'll try to keep it to under 1K.

Yes, GT2 is the best racing game of all time... but I think it could have
been a lot better.  It's loaded with bugs, which is unacceptable for a PC
game, let alone an un-patchable console game, and needless changes were made
to the front-end (I'm especially frustrated at the way the cursor often hangs
in open space in the menus, instead of defaulting to a clickable spot).
These factors, plus the load times (which admittedly are unavoidable given
the game's scope) make playing GT2 more of... well, more of a chore than it
should be.  The game's graphics are decidedly inferior to the original's,
bordering on just plain bad by any standard.  It is apparent that texture
resolution was increased so that stickers would be more readable on race
cars, but sacrificing everything else to achieve this end was a case of
fixing what wasn't broken.  All of these things combine to give GT2 a very
un-polished feel that keeps it from what I would give a "10/10" rating.

We (well, I, and those who agree) can only hope that GT2000 will not only
preserve the best elements of GT2, but fix all these hiccups... which is not
guaranteed.  It seems like Sony may very well rush its development to meet
the holiday season, just like last year; hopefully, this won't happen (or
won't be necessary), and GT2000 will be one for the record books.

By the way, a reliable source (Magic Box--http://come.to/magicbox) reports
that GT2000 is now called GT3 (since it won't be out in 2000), and will
contain "only" 150 or so cars.  I'll resist more editorialization, but I'm
sure everyone else will have a lot to say...

Okay, rant over.  Now for some miscellaneous stuff.

Mysteries of the GT40
=====================
The Ford GT40 has been bugging me for some time.  It's clearly the *road*
version of the [R]GT40 Race Car (the press blurb says so), but it gets tagged
with that [R] symbol anyway, at least in the garage listing.  Plus it can
take engine tuning, which no other "race" car can.  So I've decided that it
was a programmers' oversight to give it the [R] designation when it bears
more similarities to, say, the Toyota GT-ONE Road Car '98.  Thus, I'm
considering the GT40 a road car and not a race car.  Point against is that
you can adjust the GT40's downforce like a real race car, but the game itself
agrees with me on a certain level... that [R] disappears when the GT40 is
listed in race results. :)

Update for Version 1.2: I looked into this phenomenon some more and saw that
there are three other cars that exhibit the disappearing [R]:

Ford GT90
Renault Espace F1
Tommy kaira ZZII

However, these other three behave like race cars; i.e., no tuning except
TCSC/ASCC.  Since the GT40 can take engine tuning, I stand by my assertion
that it's an exception (read: "screwup") and should be a road car.

Adventures in GameShark Weirdness
=================================
Well, I must say that upon being directed to RogsR34UK's site by "Mr.P" of
the GameFAQs GT2 message board, I was like a kid in a candy store.  A list of
every single car in the GT2 code and the GameShark codes to get them?  Yes,
please!  But, unfortunately, most of the hidden cars are disappointments.
There's a bunch of new GT40's, a Mugen S2000, a handful of new RUFs, and
even something called a Rex Supercharger VX... but, sad to say, they're all
just body style data and not real cars.  Well, they are real cars, but their
stats are exactly the same as an RX-7 LM Edition, so there's no practical
reason to check them out unless you're into making hybrids.

The only other stuff of note is the "Esso" (rather than Exxon) versions of
various Peugeot race cars, which I'm guessing were used for the Euro version,
and a couple of hidden Shelby cars.  Don't get excited, they're just a GT350
with its logo written as "GT350" (instead of "G.T.350") and a "GT500KR" with
stats identical to the in-game GT500.  If you want to see these and the other
ones above, feel free to visit RogsR34UK's site at www.rogs.dial.pipex.com
and get the codes; the only hidden cars I've decided to include in this FAQ
are those that differ in statistics (not just name) from available cars.
