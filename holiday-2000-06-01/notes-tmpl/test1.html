Here is a shot of me playing the Sony Playstation
game <font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font>.
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS, Lucida Sans, Helvetica">
That 27 inch screen is not the one I usually use.  I was visiting
at my nephews' house when my wife snapped this great picture, with the
screen visible at an angle.
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS, Lucida Sans, Helvetica">
Instead, I usually play <font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font>
on a 19" screen.
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS, Lucida Sans, Helvetica">
In this shot, I am actually
playing <font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font> 1.
I am just starting the first race of the GT Cup, at Grand Valley Raceway, using a fully-modified hard-tuned red Dodge Viper RT/10.  These days I more
typically
play <font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font> 2.
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS, Lucida Sans, Helvetica">
I didn't actually complete the series,
but let another friend who was present
practise <font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font>
with the Viper in the warm-up laps for the subsequent race at <em>Deep
Forest Racing Way</em>.  After that it was time to watch a video, and,
since this living-room, unlike ours, is not equipped with side-by-side
television screens to allow TV viewing and Playstation use simultaneously,
I had to stop the game.
