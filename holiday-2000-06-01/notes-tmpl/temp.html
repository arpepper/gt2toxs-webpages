You have a pace car in front of you to limit your speed.  But the
problem was I was so careful about keeping my distance he didn't
take me up to the 120-125 they allow <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" alt="8-(">
</p>
<p>
And, really, I had
no idea how fast I was going.  I was watching his car all the time
and didn't really see the guages (it was a manual transmission, but there
was no shifting after you're on the track...), and there was no
speedometer, and I didn't know the rpm conversions anyway.
</p>
<p>
I realized that, perhaps perhaps because of driving video games, I was very
cautious with the accelerator.  I afterwards reasoned they must have
the cars set up so that was not necessary.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, I was less
cautious in the corners than they expected, I think, but had to brake
(yikes) several times when the pacer slowed severely in front of me.
Turned out afterwards that  he was trying to "reel me in" that way, but
I kept thwarting him.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" alt="8-)">
<p>
Natural speed limit (top) for the course with the cars is supposedly
about 145mph.
</p>

<p>
I can't find an exact lap distance.  The course is something over a
mile, but no-one knows how much.  If you assume a mile, my average
speed was about 70 mph <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" alt="8-(">,
meaning a minimum speed of even less.
Oh well, it was a fun experience, but very expensive.  I wish I
could have predicted the psychology properly.  <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" alt="8-(">
</p>

<p>
Oh well, on the positive side, I didn't stall the engine on the
way out, as at least one of the other drivers did.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" alt="8-)">
