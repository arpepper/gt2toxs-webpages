The following is a text file with somewhat detailed results for all the
Gran Turismo 1,2&3 enduroes I have done:
<ul>
<li><a href="gt1enduro.txt">gt1enduro.txt</a>
<li><a href="gt2enduro.txt">gt2enduro.txt</a>
<li><a href="gt3enduro.txt">gt3enduro.txt</a>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following is a somewhat detailed text file log I have kept for my 
Gran Turismo 4 game:
<ul>
<li><a href="gt4-game1.txt">gt4-game1</a> -
My first and, so far, only Gran Turismo 4 game.
</li>
<li><a href="gt4-racedefs.txt">gt4-racedefs.txt</a> -
Race definitions used by the my Gran Turismo 4 log program.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following is a somewhat detailed text file log I have kept for my 
Gran Turismo 3 game:
<ul>
<li><a href="gt3-game1.txt">gt3-game1</a> -
My first and, so far, only Gran Turismo 3 game.
</li>
<li><a href="gt3-racedefs.txt">gt3-racedefs.txt</a> -
Race definitions used by the my Gran Turismo 3 log program.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following are somewhat detailed text file logs I have kept for a few 
Gran Turismo 2 games.  At my personal site I actually have a CGI program
which will analyze these logs and show me the garage contents on a
particular day of the game.  That is not allowed at this Web site,
however.
</p>
<p>
So, here are the logs you can examine as text files...
<ul>
<li><a href="gt2-game1.txt">gt2-game1</a> -
My first and main Gran Turismo 2 game.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-v1.2.txt">gt2-v1.2</a> -
A moderately lengthy game using my version 1.2 disk
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-2001.txt">gt2-2001</a> -
A new game, again using my version 1.2 disk
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-proper.txt">gt2-proper</a> -
An attempt at a "proper" GT2 game, again using my version 1.2 disk
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-boom.txt">gt2-boom</a> -
A quick GT2 game I did just to demonstrate and document the garage delete
bug.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-tm30.txt">gt2-tm30</a> -
A second GT2 game I have now finished, based on the strategy of immediately entering
the Trial Mountain 30 with my starter Supra.  I got 98.20% in 237 days.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-race2pr.txt">gt2-race2pr</a> -
Branching from the first game, this is just a garage to collect as
many racing model prize cars as possible.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-normpr.txt">gt2-normpr</a> -
This is similar, but for collecting normal prizes.
Given the number of prizes
in GT2, I may need to create yet another one for normal prizes.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-histcar.txt">gt2-histcar</a> -
And this is for collecting historical used cars, such as the 1968 Toyota
2000GT.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-racepr.txt">gt2-racepr</a> -
This was the game previously used to collect racing models, and
has now been frozen.  (In fact, the save has probably been deleted by now).
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-day5ib.txt">gt2-day5ib</a> -
This is merely the first four GT2 licenses in four days, ending at day 5.
Since I bought no cars up till
then, this is very boring...
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-day7s.txt">gt2-day7s</a> -
This is merely all six GT2 licenses in six days, ending at day 7.
Since I bought no cars up till then, this is very boring...
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-mfr.txt">gt2-mfr</a> -
A new GT2 game started in February 2007, where I used the manufacturer's
races to help me choose the cars to use in other events.  Instead of using a
starter card, I actually redid all my licenses from scratch.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following are somewhat detailed text file logs I have kept for several 
Gran Turismo 1 games:
<ul>
<li><a href="main.txt">main</a> -
A pseudo-log of my main game.  I got tired of not knowing what I had done,
so faked this log--real records begin on day 5446!
</li>
<li><a href="blue.txt">blue</a> -
I got all race prize cars in 1167 game days.
</li>
<li><a href="allstars.txt">allstars</a> -
Branching off from my main game, I began collecting the stars from various
"fast" games I had done.
</li>
<li><a href="silver.txt">silver</a> -
I got all race trophies reasonably quickly, in 132 game days.
</li>
<li><a href="gold.txt">gold</a> -
I got all race trophies in the minimum possible time of 100 game days,
ending on day 101.
</li>
<li><a href="platinum.txt">platinum</a> -
Branching from the gold game,
I try for all race trophies in the minimum possible time of 100 game days,
ending on day 101, but buying even fewer cars.
</li>
<li><a href="hastings.txt">hastings</a> -
The legend of Ray Hastings, who used a 1967 Corvette Stingray as his
starter car.
With luck, no other cars need be bought, but if one is unlucky, no 4wd
will be won, necessitating a purchase.
</li>
<li><a href="nismo.txt">nismo</a> -
I use a Nissan Nismo 400R as a starter car.  You get this for all
golds on your IA license (but I didn't...).  I actually went back
to  Gran Turismo 1 to finish this game.
</li>
<li><a href="fairlady.txt">fairlady</a> -
I use the Nissan Fairlady Z Type S Twin Turbo 2 Seater as much as possible
in this minimal (100 day) game.
</li>
<li><a href="fiji.txt">fiji</a> -
I started with the 4WD Fiji Blue Mitsubishi GTO'92 in this minimal
(100 day) game.  Admitting that I am not a great player, I planned on buying
a Normal car entry.  Using careful strategy I was able to buy a Griffith; more
expensive than the Viper RT/10--the cheapest car capable of dominating the
Normal Series.  I cloned the prize Camaro as an entry for the <b>UKvsUS</b>
Series, but in theory I could have modified the single car and still kept
it technically eligible for the <b>FR</b> Series.  After completing
this game, I played a few more days of it experimenting for the 
<a href="proper.txt">proper</a> game I later did.
</li>
<li><a href="lancer.txt">lancer</a> -
I use the prize Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV GSR as much as possible.
I didn't make this game minimal, but tried to use the Mitsubishi Lancer
Evolution IV GSR as much as possible.
</li>
<li><a href="proper.txt">proper</a> -
I finished this minimal (100 day) game in license-test order.
However, to do so I allowed myself to sell prize cars.
</li>
<li><a href="mitsu.txt">mitsu</a> -
I finished this minimal (100 day) game in license-test order, selling
some prize cars.  I also used Mitsubishi cars as much as possible.
</li>
<li><a href="nissan.txt">nissan</a> -
I finished this minimal (100 day) game in license-test order, selling
some prize cars.  I also used Nissan cars as much as possible.
</li>
<li><a href="supra.txt">supra</a> -
I use the 1995 Toyota Supra RZ as much as possible in this
minimal (100 day) game.  In fact, I used Toyota for all races,
except for the UKvsUS series.
After that I went on to try out various other cars, experimenting with
possible strategies, as well as just having fun.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-24hour.txt">gt1-24hour</a> -
I tried to do this game quickly, in terms of real time.
It is not a minimal game for several reasons.
I tried to finish in one 24-hour period, but did not quite manage that.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-mazda.txt">gt1-mazda</a> -
I started this as a minimal (100 day) game.
I used Mazdas as much as possible.
After completing it, I continued to collect all the cheapest used
cars available.
After making checkpoint saves, I race-modified the cheapest instance
of each used car, and tried every one of them out in at least
one of the <b>GTI</b> (World Cup), <b>USvsJP</b>, <b>UKvsJP</b> or <b>GT
Cup</b> series.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-tuned.txt">gt1-tuned</a> -
In this offshoot of the <b>gt1-mazda</b> game, I began entering every
model of used car in the <b>Hard-Tuned Series</b>.
</li>
<li><a href="starter.txt">starter</a> -
This is merely all three licenses, ending at day 25.  By resetting the
game on failed attempts, of course.  Since I bought no cars up till
then, this is very boring...
</li>
</ul>
