<font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In the spring of 1998, <b>Sony</b> released in North America a new car-racing game for their
<b>PlayStation</b> console videogame system.  Entitled
<font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font><font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font>,
many people consider that this game set new standards in realism of racing
games, specifically in the modeling of car physics.  I bought this game
in December 1998 and quite quickly became hooked.  Fans of
<font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font><font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font>,
tend to refer to it as simply <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font>.  When Sony came out with a sequel,
<font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font><font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font> <font size="+1" color="gray">2</font>, that became similarly known as
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="gray">2</font>.
I myself bought <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="gray">2</font> on
the very first day of its North American release.
</p>
<p>
So now I call myself <b>GT2toXS</b>.  Read it aloud, and think about it.
</p>
<p>
Originally, when posting to usenet groups I wanted a little anonymity,
so I began using <b>GT2XS</b> as my name, but when <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="gray">2</font>
came out, that began to look ambiguous, so I switched to <b>GT2toXS</b>.
</p>
<p>
So, I seem to have created some <font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font><font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font> <a href="gt/">pages</a>;
see what you think of them.
</p>
<p>
I do know from looking at logs for the original version of this site that
the occasional person does come to get copies of my <a href="gt/results_forms/">results forms</a>.  And I have collected a rather lengthy collection
of other <font size="+1" color="blue">
G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font> <a href="gt/">links</a> as well; many of them
probably even still work.  <img src="bitmaps/happyfrog.gif"  alt="8-)" width="30" height="18" border="0" >
</p>
<p>
In early 1999, I seemed to have several long email
conversations talking about <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font>,
and I used these to start a Web page <a href="gt/diary/">diary</a>.  This
can be interesting reading, as it documents my increase in skill-level
from truly deplorable to mediocre.  Some of that documentation is
very self-indulgent--detailed race results, for instance--but in other
parts I mention game hints I discovered or learned from others, and
even <b>GameShark</b> codes I wrote down from others, or discovered or
enhanced myself.  I sort of thought maybe one day I'd mine all that
information, and rearrange it to create some other <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font>
informational pages, but that happened to only a limited extent.
The <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font>
pages I did create on my original site made extensive use of CGI's and
I don't think they can be made to work here.
</p>
<p>
However, please do notice that my diary is arranged as a number of threads,
allowing you to skip to the next page covering some topic you happen
to find interesting, rather than forcing you to look at every daily entry.
(Entries were not made every single day--sometimes I'd only occasionally
make an entry, and at other times they would be more frequent).
</p>
<p>
Also of interest to people who would be interested in these
<font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font><font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font> pages is my small photo album <a href="holiday-2000-06-01/">page</a> featuring
my trip to the Richard Petty Driving Experience, at his facility in Orlando,
Florida.
