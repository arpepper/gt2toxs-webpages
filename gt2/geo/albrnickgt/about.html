<table width="85%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<P>
I want to make it clear I did not create the <b>Gran Turismo Pit Stop</b>
myself, but I hope that, by presenting a version of it here, everyone can
find it as useful as I did.

Shortly after I first got <font size="+1" color="blue">Gran</font> <font size="+1" color="red">Turismo</font> <font size="+1">(1)</font>, I discovered
the <b>Gran Turismo Pit Stop</b> website created by <b>albrnick</b>.
</P>
</td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<P>
The car comparison he provided, written by
<A HREF="mailto:SpannNRoss@worldnet.att.net">Michael Spann</A>.
was particularly useful as I started to attack 
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> seriously.
I later made a few contributions to the pages myself, tracking down
details like license test times and obscure prize values.
</P>
</td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<P>
And so, when I noticed <b>albrnick</b>'s pages disappear from his original site,
I retrieved them from the
<b><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">o</font><font color="yellow">o</font><font color="blue">g</font><font color="green">l</font><font color="red">e</font></b> cache and tidied them up so I could present them here.
Using information from my diaries, I filled in all the missing details, and
even added complete lists of all AI competitors for each simulation event.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:SpannNRoss@worldnet.att.net">Michael Spann</A>'s CGI-based
car comparison had previously inspired me to write my own, which I
later translated into <b>JavaScript</b>, allowing me to host it here,
hooking it in in place of <A HREF="mailto:SpannNRoss@worldnet.att.net">Michael</A>'s.
The statistics I use are, in fact, obtained from <b>David Connoy</b>'s complete
car list FAQ.  But <A HREF="mailto:SpannNRoss@worldnet.att.net">Michael Spann</A>
and <b>albrnick</b> were definitely my primary inspiration.
</P>
</td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<P>
One part I have removed is <b>albrnick</b>'s <em>best times</em> pages.
They had never totally caught on, and were particularly stale by the end.  It
would not have been worth the work of retrieving all those records pages,
and, over all, I think the site at this point in time is better without them.
