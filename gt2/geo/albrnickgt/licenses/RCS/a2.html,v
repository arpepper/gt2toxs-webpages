Keep left on the approach down the straight.  As you near the left side
curb, release the gas and jump on the brakes.  Don't press too long, but
long enough that you can crank the wheel full right and skid a bit.  You
should slide the tail enough to angle past the apex of the turn, then
you should be coasting.  As you reach the apex of the turn, jump on the
gas and ride it out.  It's really easy once you try it.  Actually, watch
the demo to figure it out.
