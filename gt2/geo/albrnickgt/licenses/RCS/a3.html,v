<PRE>
I just spent much of this afternoon, and about 50 tries, getting
past A-3.  Based on the demo, here were the "targets" I was shooting
for:

1) try to exit the first 's' curve in 4th, at 98-101 mph.
2) I stayed in 4th until about 130 (there's a blue/white box on a pole
on the right side of the track), and then go to 5th.  It also seemed
to help (for the next turn) to stay middle or right on the straightaway.
3) When entering the curve to the left that begins the hairpin,
try to keep to the outside/left (guess that's kinda obvious).
4) I tried to give myself about 1/2 sec or so between coming off
the accelerator and slamming on the brake.  The demo did this and I
think it allows the car to straighten out so it doesn't go all wobbly
when you do slam that brake.
5) Just a bit after you start braking, downshift and then start the
turn to the right, downshift again.  I seemed to always take this turn in 
two "steps", once in 3rd and another in 2nd, and it seemed helpful to
never stray below 50 mph or so.
6) Accelerate ASAP from 2nd in the inside lane to the end.

For what seemed like forever, I kept getting 1/2 second or less away
from passing, but eventually it happens.

Hope this helps!  (I'm also getting some sense of closure by posting
this -- it's like all that time was for more than just passing A-3).

Forget about all the other stuff you posted.  The keys to this test are
holding the throttle in all the way to the last turn.  You can go flat
out through the S's without a problem.  Keep a straight track on the
straight.  As you crest the back hill, release the gas, jam on the brake
and slide the car sideways.  As soon as you are sideways, jam on the
accelerator and if need be, lightly tap the brake (w/o letting off the
gas) to keep from running into the dirt.

[NOTE:  You will want to slide towards the inside part of the turn, not
the outside.  Doing it on the ouside reduces the amount of track you
have and always ends up in the dirt]

You should exit the turn with about 37sec on the clock.  That should put
you about .200 seconds under 44.  In other words, 43:800 or so.  THE CAR
MUST SLIDE.

You have to hit the brakes as soon as you crest the hill.  You then
steer to the inside of the turn and crank the steering wheel so that the
car gets sideways.  Jump on the gas, and you should drift around the
corner and pop out without having to brake, and with plenty of time to
spare.  The drifting takes some time to get used to, especially how far
sideways to get, and when to jump on the gas.  Also, remember to keep
full throttle through the first s-turns, no need to brake there.

For A3, I started braking a little sooner. I would tap the brake as I came
over the hill BEFORE I started turning (so I wouldn't spin out). I found
that this got me to the right speed so when I turned the wheel and hit the
brakes a split second later, I could really bury the nose of the car right
on the inside stripes, and get power back reasonably quickly to get up to
speed. The key is not to slide too far to the outside of the turn. You
need to get the momentum of the car going into the turn BEFORE you begin
to slide, so when you recover you're already through much of the turn and
can punch it.
