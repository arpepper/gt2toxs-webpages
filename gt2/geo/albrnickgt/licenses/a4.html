Make sure you're on the left side of the road, then brake AND turn earlier
than you want to, to the point where you think you're going to hit the
rock on the inside of the turn. If you JUST miss it, you're taking the
corner right.

You don't even need to brake for this exam.  I got gold by letting off
the gas and drifting the first turn.  The second turn needs to be taken
full bore.  It's a matter of turning real early and maybe feathering the
gas if you need to.  The last left hand turn into the tunnel needs to be
initiated EARLY.  As you exit the fast right hander into the tunnel, you
should be near the right side wall.  Immediately start turning left
towards the inside of the upcoming turn, and feather the gas about
midway through the turn.  You should be running in the yellow rumble
strip area.  After you apex, jump on the gas, and try not to make big
corrections in your heading down the final straight.  Good luck.
