<PRE>
I think your initial confusion has to do with the difference between
powersliding and drifting. In a powerslide, your rear wheels have lost all
traction and the rear of the car "swings around" for serious oversteer.
While this can help you turn on tight corners, it usually does 3 things:
(1) takes your car off of the "racing line" because you tend to slide to
the outside of the turn, (2) eats up a lot of your speed, and (3) makes it
difficult to get control back and get back up to speed quickly. DRIFTING,
on the other hand, is when you are pushing the traction of your tires to
the limit. The tires ARE squealing a little, but you haven't lost control
of the car yet. Unlike a powerslide, when you are drifting you can
maintain the racing line, and you can get back on the accelerator and get
your car back up to speed quickly.

Drifting is definitely the fastest way to take corners. The problem is
that drifting is MUCH more difficult than powersliding. To powerslide, all
you have to do is overcome the friction of the rear tires. To drift, you
have to take the tires right to their friction limit and then hold them
there throughout the turn. Since your speed, acceleration, turn radius,
and weight distribution all effect friction, keeping your car in a drift
throughout a turn can require constant adjustment
