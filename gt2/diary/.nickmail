So, we decided to get Gran Turismo because we thought my nephew
might enjoy it.  8-)  Oh, alright, the sales clerk where I bought
it didn't believe me either.

Anyway, on the page

 http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/licenses/

you list "cars for getting all Golds".

Is this because in versions of Gran Turismo previous to the one I
purchased they let you use your own car for the license tests?

That doesn't seem possible.

Hmm.  I see I need to track down Bob Chmilnitzky wrt tuning comments.

One thing I find amusing is that if you have multiple instances
of the same car (a Mazda Demio perhaps  8-)  you can "share"
tune-up parts without purchasing new ones.  You can even have
the parts installed in both cars simultaneously.
Conversely, it's not clear that "one time irreversible" modifications
can be done to a second car after having been done to a first.
(E.g. weight reduction).  It does seem possible to keep a racing
and non-racing version of the same car.  E.g. a pretty raspberry
near-stock Cerbera and a somewhat ugly mostly grey racing modified
one.

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/cars/prize/

Hmm.  You do not give the key info I would like to see there.
Namely, for which events are which cars prizes?

As far as I can tell Demios are a unit of currency within the game.
8-)  The GT League cars almost wait for you to win the series, and this
is a good way of getting about cr25000 + a Demio (worth cr12000 at a
Mazda dealer, cr10000 elsewhere  8-) I wonder if real-life Demios spend
a lot of their racing time on 3 or even two wheels?  Strange thing is
you don't get significantly more compensation for winning the more
difficult FF and FR series.  (Can't really say yet about the 4W or
lightweight series yet).

It's interesting; simulation mode is like "Test Drive" (is that a dirty
word?) but using the psychological trick of increasing the perceived
value of driving a particular car by making you work a little bit for
it.

Oh well, I guess you've probably forgotten about these pages, and are
somewhat surprised to be receiving mail about them.

I don't think I'd want to start my own GT pages, but might be persuaded
to do some updates to other peoples'.  Or perhaps I should find someone
to do a sort of "trading mirror" with.  I.e. I'd first mirror their
pages, make some modifications, and then offer them back.

Sigh.  I really don't need motivation which might cause me to spend an
excessive amount of time doing "research", however.

Are you a student at Ohio University?

I actually work here at Waterloo.

Duh.  I finally realized that the "cars for getting all Golds" are
"the cars awarded as prizes for getting all Golds".  Perhaps now you
can see my confusion.

I'm surprised you replied already.

We have cgi facilities available here, but the URL references would
probably need to be changed.  I've written a few sleazy cgi scripts,
and perl scripts of various sizes working outside cgi.  Hmm.  HTML etc
needs a way to refer to "my wrapped cgi bin" symbolically.  I don't
think that can currently be done.  OTOH, unless you store data,
I don't suppose the cgis need to be wrapped.

Software support.  Started as system programming years ago, now mostly
systems administration.

Another thing...

I'm really new to this PlayStation thing.  Is there by any chance
a "download" of some sort that will allow manipulation of Replay
files?  E.g. copying existing replays from one file on one card
to a larger file on another card?

I've only seen the term "memory card download"--never actually loaded
one and used it, so I can only imagine that they might occasionally be
such utilities that can be loaded and executed.

Oh well.  The RCA video adapter is plugged into my VCR.  I might start
storing a different style of Replay.   8-)

Perhaps it was different, or perhaps you've forgotten.
(There is no way to get GT to confess any sort of version number
information, is there?)

Basic GT game state is 5 blocks of card memory.  (The blocks of which
a standard card has 15).

GT car settings data is separate, and seems to be always 2 of those blocks,
and is room for 120 separate car settings.

The Replay data is also another separate memory card file, but requires
you to choose how big to make it.  They refer to the size in sectors,
and I think you get about 60 of those sectors per memory block, and
need something over 20 for the average replay.  Yes, you can copy the
entire Replay file to another card, but you do not seem to be able to
copy one Replay file on top of an existing one on the other card in any
way.  The upshot is that on the particular memory card you are stuck
with your initial choice of file size.  (To add to confusion, the
replay elements within the memory card "file" are also referred to as
"files"; what I'd like to be able to do, you see, is copy individual
replay files from within one replay File and put those replay files
inside another replay File.  I've used "file" there for the "replay
elements", and "File" for the entity the main Memory Card editor sees.)

The best thing to do is probably keep all replays on a separate card
and allocate all 15 blocks.  But it makes me nervous switching cards
with the power on, especially since you don't seem to be able to view
contents, etc. of cards from within the game.  (Plus it's just after
Christmas, and it's hard to find more of the things to buy...)

[Aside: It would be really nice to be able to get to and from the main
"Options" menu, e.g. just before starting a race, if, e.g. one track
is better viewed in narrow mode, while others are better in normal or
wide, or especially to set 2 player settings, e.g. laps, handicap,
etc.]

I've seen the term "memory card download" on the "Jampack" CDs that
come with Playstation club subscription and/or are occasionally retailed
real cheap and in fact was thrown in free with the PlayStation I bought.
(I bought mine at Canadian Tire; ever heard of them?  Wal-Mart hadn't
when they conducted phone surveys prior to moving in up here).

I am just speculating that Sony could make extension utilities
available as memory card downloads.

The downloads on the JamPack CD I have are for some other game, and I
think do the usual sleazy free life type stuff.  Ah.  I guess that
would be done by just downloading a file containing a certain game
state.  E.g. they could make a download for GT with B license and
a couple of cars and a couple of cr100K.  (And then there's that Shark
thing I saw referred to at another site; how unsporting...)
But perhaps pre-configured game configurations is the limit of what
they do with downloads.  Providing a means to transfer execution to
within the memory card ROM would open up a whole can of worms which
Sony probably doesn't want to.

Sony Card?  Oh.  Does Sony make Cards for the PlayStation?   8-)

It does seem strange to recommend putting the cards in with the station
powered on, because GT will eventually check for the presence of a card
with no intervention needed on your part.  I wonder what happens if it
checks exactly when you are inserting the card?  Of course maybe they
don't recommend powering up with a CD in either.  Gee I'm rambling again.
I guess they would recommend 1) power up  2) insert cards 3) load CD.

I've bought four cards so far, but none of them are Sony's.  8-)
I don't think there's any documentation with them.  Just a bright green
piece of paper with a picture of a cartoon wolf on it.

Of course I have had one load error and one save error so far.  Both
went away on a retry.  I always do a save to each card, and have
backups as well.  8-)  I've also had apparent CD errors, twice after
finishing a series 8-(, two other times after doing good qualification
times for Autumn Ring in Sunday Cup.  You can also lock the animation
up temporarily, or worse, by holding down "rear view" for too long.
The errors after finishing a series may be another bug, and I now
always use "exit" to get to the Dealer map in order to "go race" and
never "short cut" via the checkered flag in any of the other screens.
But coincidentally with that I've tried to become good about shutting
the station off for at least five minutes after a maximum of two
hours.  The manual expresses concerns that the users' health may suffer
if they do not take a rest every hour or so, but I wonder if that's
not a way to try and get users to avoid overheating problems with the
PlayStation.  I also made little feet out of a toilet roll to improve
airflow underneath the PlayStation.  Eventually, perhaps, I'll do
something more permanent.  They stopped it getting so hot, but have
not prevented all strange errors.

I mentioned Canadian Tire Stores before.  One neat feature of them is
that if you pay with cash they give you a 3% discount in the form of
"Canadian Tire Money"; genuine bank notes in denominations of 5, 10,
25, 50cents or one dollar, useable as cash at their store.  So the
$5.70 I got for buying the PlayStation plus one $10 memory card,
together with most of the rest of my at-home "stash" was enough to buy
a $10 memory card ($11.50 with tax).  (And I still got back 30 cents
more Canadian Tire money  8-)

In your comparison form,

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/cars/comparison.html

You should have a "NONE" Option in each "Manufacturer" category box.
That would allow one to search, say, only Mitsubishis.  Etc.

Ideally, you want to be able to pick multiple cars.  Hmm.  "Shift click"
seems to do that in Windows Netscape.  Which suggests there may be a 
non-obvious way to deselect everything, but I can't find it, and it's
semi-browser-specific, and I *think* it would be easy to add a "NONE"
which cancelled all entries from that manufacturer.

Ah.  In lynx (on UNIX) it comes up differently, and it is easy to
toggle each of the boxes for each car independently.

And, thinking some more, I now find that in Windows Netscape
"CTRL-click" deselects a selection and therefore you can deselect
everything.  And, yes I was just able to get a table of Mitsubishis
only.

Again that would be browser-specific, so you can't really add
documentation to the page.  If it would be easy to add "NONE", I think
it would be a good idea, even thought it would be technically
redundant.  Perhaps you could say something like "your browser
probably has facilities to allow zero, one or multiple selections
from each box; consult your documentation".

The page is very useful.  All-round, your Gran Turismo site is one of
the better ones.  What you've got is reasonably complete, as opposed to
some which have just the start of some portions of them.

Hmm.  "ALL" could be considered redundant, too, but without it your
post data could get *very* long, couldn't it?

Subject: Good weekend.
Status: RO

Well, at the end of last week, I had all 8 arcade tracks and my
Toyotas.  During the weekend I finished off the rest of the tracks at
easy, and got all the cars.

On tracks with good traction and line-of-sight, that Viper ridiculously
outclasses the competition.  8-)  So I have five tracks done at normal,
with the A class done at difficult on those five.

I discovered another trick.  I have a racing Subaru Legacy in emulation
mode (You need to buy at least one four-wheel drive car, and my
nephew's parents have a Legacy, so I thought it would be fun to race
one...)  I've tuned the engine fully, but am too cheap to buy subtle
stuff like a racing clutch  8-), and boy are they serious about that
low-speed torque problem.  I lost control up the hill in Trial Mountain
II, and the car would not start moving.  I thought, "in real life, I
might pop the clutch, but I don't have an explicit clutch, so perhaps
I'd better pit in and lower(raise) the first gear".  But then I
realized that in real life, before popping the clutch, I'd have to hold
the car on the handbrake, and, sure enough, if you rev against the
handbrake and then release it, it sort of lets you emulate popping the
clutch, and the car gets enough of a jump to start moving fast enough
to be in efficient first gear range.  Now, one of those triple plate
clutches might solve this problem; perhaps I'll try it sometime.  When
I seem to have an excess of Cr.  (I wonder why the races all pay out in
Chromium?  8-)

Late last night for fun I dug up the Jam Pack demo disk version of
Gran Turismo, with a Honda NSX, 90's Corvette, and [R]Subaru Impreza on
the Clubman Route 5, with choice of easy, normal and difficult.  After
a little practice it was relatively easy to win with all three cars at
easy and normal.  Almost startlingly so.  Just don't worry about the
body panel damage.  8-)  (It's not like I drive right along the wall,
but on most of the corners at least the tail touches the wall at least
once; I'm sure they clean that up somewhat in the replays) I won with
the Corvette at difficult, and kept coming second with the other cars.
That demo sells the game short.  Grand Valley East would be a much
better demonstration, with its sand traps around the hairpins.

One funny thing is that the back of the racing Impreza says "SURARU",
not "SUBARU".  Quite clearly, both while driving it from behind, and
when it is spinning on the display stand.  It says "SUBARU" on the
sides, though.

After that I tried the Test Drive 5 Demo.  Test Drive 4 had impressed
me when my nephew had rented it once when I was over there before I
got my own Gran Turismo Station, but did the Test Drive 5 demo ever
seem atrocious.  Not quite as bad as Grand Tour Racing, but it
seemed mostly easy.  I never used to like slow-moving traffic in race
games, but it seemed somewhat irrelevant in Test Drive.  My reactions
had sharpened to accomodate it.  It was difficult to see what would put
your speeding car out of control.  And while Gran Turismo scenery does
not seem totally realistic, Test Drive 5 looked like a cartoon.  And
they don't have proper route maps.  And, if it is like Test Drive 4,
they don't have circuit races at all.  (Not sure if you can't win the
demo or if I just kept choosing the wrong forks 8-); if potential
customers lose a demo game, it is better if they know clearly why).

But based on those two demos, my nephew (and also his mother) seem to
prefer Test Drive 5 over Gran Turisimo.  One of these days we'll have
to confess to having Gran Turismo.  8-)  In theory I should be able to
lend him my disk sometime.  But not until after I, and I, and I...  8-)

Verbosely,


Adrian.

Repeatedly failing my A-3 test (I can reliably come within a second
now...8-) sure helps my high speed straight to low speed cornering
technique.

When I first tried the GT demo weeks ago the NSX was a pig to drive.
It seemed to have super excess oversteer.  Drift mode seemed to reduce
that, but, as far as I can tell, drift mode makes it impossible to win,
but maybe I should try that again too.  The manual is really vague
about the purpose of drift mode.  8-)

Similarly I used to have a tendency to induce overcorrection
oscillation into the Subaru Impreza's movements.   That tendency
seems to have vanished.

And the Corvette always seemed nice to drive, but now I can hold a
slide before it turns into a spin and so I actually finish without
spinning out.  8-)  Actually, I won with it once after I did spin it
out; it might not even have been easy mode, either.  Those competitors
are so polite the way they wait for you when you slow down.   8-)  It
does make it difficult to tell what your target time is for a
particular course/mode however...  (Though again, that is somewhat
realistic; Juan Manuel Fangio used to say that to win a race you
drive just fast enough to win, and no faster).

One interesting game might be to try and set the slowest winning time.
Try and see how much you can utilize (abuse?) the handicapping
algorithm and still be able to win with a very fast finish.

Conversely, when I finally did win with a Toyota Soarer in normal on
the Autumn Ring, it sure seemed like the computer's Eclipse slowed down
right at the end.  It was right behind me, but dropped from second
place to fourth place for no apparent reason.  I think perhaps it
realized it was going to go below the programmed time for normal mode,
and slowed down because of that.  Usually I botch something after the
hill climb and cannot stay or get ahead on the finishing straight.  I
think I saw the same phenomenon with a Civic on Grand Valley East.  I
had a Civic too, and I was behind at the last corner but passed the
other Civic into first on the finishing stretch.  It didn't look like
the other car had botched its exit or anything, and my exit was just
okay, not great.  It sure looked like the other car slowed down.  That
might even have been in difficult mode.  But if you've done anything
wrong and are working on a slow time, the other cars always seem to
have a strong finish.

Speaking of botching, it is amusing when the competitors try and taunt
you into a bad turn by braking too late and losing control.  8-)
(Sometimes a gentle tap from behind can help mess up their calculations,
but that's not always necessary; they definitely do it all by themselves
sometimes  8-)

I'll try to keep this brief.  8-)

Finished all Normal and got the Credits yesterday!
So I guess I shouldn't give up.  8-)
Trial Mountain "C" was the last "normal" I got.
Lots of subtle places on that course to wring speed out of the Civic.
Game doesn't let you save the replay of the win, because it goes
straight to the credits then back to the menu.  8-(   8-)

Done some Difficult.  A-B-C on High Speed Ring and Clubman R5. And a
couple of others "A" only (where Viper works well  8-) I finally
realized that position relative to #1 is more important at all times
than your position #.  E.g. expecially on Arcade Grand Valley full
circuit where that HUGE bump before second hairpin means other cars are
likely to knock you out of control.  At "normal" level, at least,
deliberately staying behind (or fifth) before each navigation of that
bump seemed to help.  Computer cars seem to be expert jumpers.

Impreza in general seems urealistically easy to control.

Oh.  And I finally completed A-3.  Using automatic. 8-( Qualified
by only .006 seconds; closest I came without qualifying was .008
over.  Don't know whether my skill level will ever get to where
cost/benefit analysis would justify drifting all such corners
habitually, although the exercise has probably reduced my time
for that stretch by 3 seconds even without totally drifting the
corner.

Handbrake helps all starts with engines with low low-speed torque,
e.g. for a second practice run where they don't operate your "clutch"
for you, or if you spin to a stop anywhere, not just up hills.

Like two identical purchased cars, two identical prizes can share parts
(e.g. two Demios  8-), but a prize, e.g. Civic(Racer) cannot share
parts with a purchased Civic(Racer).

But games knows that you need to purchase separate e.g. port polishing
and weight reduction for each, and allows it.

Subject: I got my A class license!!!
Status: R

Strange, I had thought I'd manage to get all the Arcade red bonus dots first.
I've got all but four red dots.  None on Trial Mountain (I have done a
concerted effort at it yet), and I am having trouble with B class on
Deep Forest.  C class I won after persisting with a field in which I
noticed that the car which started second consistently moved up and
finished first.  That can cause interference which you can take
advantage of.

A class.
My wife stayed overnight at her sister's on Wednesday, and so I stayed
up far too late.  First I went back and reassured myself by redoing all
my B class tests.  That is a waste of "days" in the simulation, since
you end up wanting to keep all the records.  8-)  I got lots of silvers,
and gold for the start/stop tests.  The second start/stop I didn't get
gold until I accidentally put it in automatic.  So there I learned that
in automatic you get automatic optimal downshift help.  Can be useful
on some courses and tests, but in general I find I want to know what
gear I'm in and don't want the torque at the wheels suddenly changing,
etc.  E.g. I tested automatic on Arcade Deep Forest B, and seemed to
lose about 5 or 10 seconds a lap.  Their shifting is reasonably good,
but can't, e.g. anticipate a hill or bend which makes a marginal
upshift detrimental.

I guess it does say in the manual, but it's still sort of disappointing
when you do a silver time not as good as your previous silver time and
so only get a bronze "prize".  It's sort of fun when G.T. Silver
disappears from the records...

One of the cornering tests, and the final are still bronze.  Quite quickly
I got a time on the final about .05 seconds over silver, but never got
any better.  (Final is Eunos around High Speed Ring).

I realized that the biggest problem in Gran Turismo had helped make it
difficult to pass the cornering tests the first time.  The corners
looked like ninety-degree corners, but are almost 180.  (I recognize it
now, of course, as Deep Forest).  I exacerbated that problem by using
"wide" view option.  You need to apex a lot later than visual input
alone suggests.  If I were making up the tests, I would include a
simple ninety-degree cornering test.  Maybe two; one with long straight
before, another with long straight afterwards.  I now use "narrow"
view, and the problem is less severe, but still noticeable.

So things clicked for the A tests.  I finished A-7 before A-6.  I did
not need to use the handbrake to get bronze in the A-7 test even though
they say you do.  I just drove conservatively and tight.

A-6, a twiddly section from Deep Forest, stumped me for a while.  It
was gratifying that I used my head to solve it.  I realized that
on the second sharp corner, before the short straight into the
second tunnel, you needed to apex late (go deep) so you got better
acceleration into what is essentially the finishing straight.
So, on a time when braking, downshifting, turning and then accelerating
through the first sharp corner all came together, I concentrated on
going a bit deep into the second, and sure enough, I got my bronze.

A-8 was weird.  It took me a relatively long time to learn to keep the
Supra RZ on the road and even get a time.  That was about 4 seconds
over.  The car tends to understeer a lot and is difficult to provoke
into oversteer at all.  In fact, I went and checked the specs because I
began to suspect it was a stupid 4WD.  Anyway, shortly after the
first run which got a time, I came down to within a second of my
bronze.  Sometime after that was a run where I 360'd twice in the
first hairpin but somehow did not "FAIL", so I kept going for the
practice.  So, I begin remembering A-3 and A-4 and how long they took,
and I decide "you're not going to get this one tonight", and just
relaxed and thought of it as educational practice at both conscious and
subliminal levels.  And so what happens, but a few runs later everything
comes together reasonably well and I get 1:17.556, almost 1/2 second
under.  (And I probably hadn't reset the game as recently as I would
have if I had expected to pass  8-).  I'm up to almost 1000 days now;
I really think they should announce "New Year's" for you.  Play
Auld Lang Syne or something).

This is almost like a diary.  I keep all my outgoing mail.  Some of
this might be synthesizable into Web pages if I can decide on a focus.

So, now it's almost late and really I should to bed, but after saving
the final replay (it obviously wasn't perfect, and didn't feel so as I
did the run, and will probably be very good for analysis), and saving
the game state with the A license, I wanted to make use of it.

I'd read that the "Clubman Series" was a good way to make a bit of
Chromium (that's what "Cr" stands for, isn't it??? 8-)), and so I
entered that.  Not knowing what to expect, I used my racing Cerbera.

Comments on the entry screen say "requires advanced racing skills", so
I felt glad that I had chosen the racing Cerbera.  However, really the
screen should say "requires advanced racing skills or a car which
absurdly outclasses the field".  First race, Autumn Ring, I crank up
the final drive, try some practice, seem pretty smooth, start to
qualify, and it's a total disaster.  But, I note, that my initial test
run (from standing start) was 4 seconds faster than the first place
qualifier.  So that was encouraging.  Race starts, and I tear away in
front, no problem with the hairpins, but then I lose it completely
on the 270degree corner after the underpass, forgetting about my
upshift quick spin recovery technique.  So I'm way back in 6th, and
think, well they'll wait a little, so maybe I'll salvage 5th or 4th,
but, no, I easily manage to get back into first just before the
underpass the second time.  So I take it really easy from there on.
The section up the hill to the "stadium" part is tricky too.  Each car
seems to need a different technique,  so, I loaf along.  This turns out
to be enough to actually anger the handicapping algorithm into sending
a car past me.  But I just stay behind and power past it on the final
straight.  Advanced driving techniques, don't you know.

So then on Clubman R5 and Trial Mountain I get pole and win both,
leading from start to finish.  I really hate that Clubman track, the
way it's not worth trying to avoid "clipping" the walls.  And portions
of my drive around Trial Mountain made me think "Nobody needs to buy
Test Drive Offroad; this is like an off-road test drive".  But with a
car like the Cerbera you can get away with all that nonsense and win
anyway.  So I win my first Camaro (of probably many more to come),
along with all the quite generous associated Chromium.  Oh well,
sometime when I've got more time I'll enter tougher series and take
proper amounts of practice time with whatever car I'm using, and try to
make it all look more elegant.  And I can remember that this series
exists to finance my bad habits even faster than the Sunday Cup.

And I must admit those A-class tests do help with taking the trickier
parts of Trial Mountain.

The fact they have only 11 tracks and run them backwards to get more
indicates they are short of space on the CD.  (Trial Mountain II
actually has the arrows going the wrong way!!!)  This is unfortunate
because I think it would be fun if the "game map" actually corresponded
to a simulated village you needed to drive around.  Portions of the
village would probably look suspiciously like portions of the R5 and
R11 courses.  There could be cops who would give you tickets for
speeding and dangerous driving.  I'm not sure how you'd get around to
buy your first car, or get back after a sale, however.  8-)  (GTTA?
Gran Turismo Transit Authority?)  (Gee, maybe they could make you racer
by day, Leisure Suit Larry by night.  The more races you win, the
more...)  8-)

Another fantasy enhancement is a 1929 Bentley, but I'm not sure if
their car drawing routines could handle that, let alone the problem
with getting a physics model for it.  And licensing.  It would probably
feel like a pig to drive anyway.

Subject: Tentative info for your Spot Race charts
Status: R

This is long again, but it contain one definite web page correction.
(A-8 time is 1:08), and a tentative statement about another page.
Again, perhaps I could eventually take some of the rambling out of
my outgoing mailbox and put it into web pages eventually.

I wonder, what's the youngest age at which children can really
appreciate Gran Turismo?  When can children understand manual
transmission?  I vaguely remember understanding it between
grade 6 and grade 7 (roughly, um, add 5, 11 years old).

Anyway, in the charts for the Spot Races in

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/races/

E.g.

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/races/high_speed_ring.html

You still have $XXX for 2nd,3rd,4th,5th

I think it is 500,400,300,200

I'm 80% sure that 2nd is Cr500.
You can then interpolate the rest, and I'm pretty sure I was never
surprised at the amount I got.
Note the big premium for coming 1st, not 2nd.

I'm 95% sure that pole position gets Cr500.

I am making assumptions that all races pay out the same.
I probably came second on more than one track.

How did you determine the pole times?  Don't they vary?
Or do they only vary down to some floor, which you list?
Of course, it gets messy once you get pole, because you have to do
arithmetic to figure out what the 2nd guy's time actually was.

I have observed that pole times for Spot Races seem to be better than
ones for the same track in the Sunday Cup.

Is "beginner,intermediate,advanced,professional" a ranking you made up?

If so, it might be nice to indicate somehow that Sunday Cup and
Clubman Cup are actually easier than Spot Races.  The two series
seem to be just an easy way to raise Cr (And Demios and Camaros) to
support your habits.  Not having different values for different
prize cars is "not a nice touch".  I.e. different values for
different prize cars would be "a nice touch".

For all races it would be nice to give some winning times, or "time
needed to win".  Best time is sort of irrelevant.  Worst winning time
(by a human) would be more relevant.  8-)  Time of computer winner when
you come close second is probably best indicator of needed time, but
the handicap algorithm is strange.  More strictly, time of computer
winner when you drove a clean race and came a close second might
indicate the time.  (Since if you have a catastrophe, they do seem
to wait for you).  Time of second place competitor is some indication,
but in some series they seem to hang just behind you no matter how
fast you go, or, to a point, how slow you go.

In Sunday Cup, High Speed Ring, the strange handicapping algorithm
which usually manages to finish a car about 1 second behind you
fails as you can leave all 5 cars > 10 seconds behind.  8-)
Of course, once you get to >13 seconds or so, you can't even tell
how far ahead you were.  8-(  (On other tracks I think I've had
up to about 5 or 6 seconds before the 2nd place car).

Oh.

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/licenses

You still have a "?" in the bronze time for A-8.  At the beginning of
the test they tell you the needed time is 1:08.

The A4 tips are confusing-sounding and dubious.
It takes a while to work out in Duane Laviniere's description that he
is not counting the initial left-hander through the first tunnel as a
turn.  And therefore what he calls the "first turn" is actually the
second turn.

We don't seem to get rec.games.video.sony here.  8-(

Oh well.  Your license advice never did quite flesh out the way you
hoped, did it?

Although I didn't need it for B-1, I'd suggest to people that they
use an automatic transmission for B-1 and B-2 if they want to get gold
quickly, because the computer optimally downshifts (engine brakes) for
them when they brake.  This seemed sort of counter-intuitive to me,
but it makes sense when you think about how the cars are emulated and
the goals of the game designers.

Conversely, attempting to get gold in B-2 using manual transmission
would be a good way to learn to quickly downshift properly.  I've
come to the conclusion that if you over-downshift, the emulation
acts on the assumption that your clutch is out until car speed is low
enough to match maximum engine speed.  That is, you lose your engine
braking until the car is slow enough for the new gear.  Do you think
that is the case?

Another good place to practice proper downshifts is A-3 and A-8.  I
actually ended up using automatic in A-3, but got my bronze in 
A-8 with manual.  It is nice to stay in the same gear as you manipulate
the throttle.  But in A-3 my lack of co-ordination seemed to over-ride
that concern.  But in arcade mode I tried automatic to see if it would
help my Mitsubishi Eclipse win Difficult in Deep Forest Racing Way and
it seemed to drastically reduce my times.  (it is actually "Racing
Way", isn't, it, not "Raceway"--frustrated Japanese sort of throwing
our confusing grammar rules back at us, maybe).

Proper downshifting is difficult, of course, because you need, for each
gear of each car, to determine what tach speed in that gear corresponds
to the red-line in the next lower gear.  For upshifting, you basically
just shift when you hit the red-line.  (You may want to shift a little
later if there is a big jump to the next gear, or earlier if the next
gear is very close).  Of course, that infinitely-variable "racing
gearbox" can be used to make the downshift tach speed a constant as
well.  8-)  Good thing I wasn't in charge of the project, or you'd
have to choose gears and final-drive from a (large) set of discrete
integer ratios.  8-)  (I'd express them as decimals, but I think it
would be more realistic and in someways simpler to limit the
granularity).  Even when shifting by ear, you don't get a definite
clue when to downshift, because actual engine speed will be different
for different downshifts.  In real-life in one's one and only car,
one learns what each gear sounds like when the engine could stand
the gear one lower, and also knows the speed ranges (if one has a
cheap car without a tach; notice how all Japanese cars with automatics
come with tach because automatic is more luxurious than tach, but
most Japanese cars with manual do not have a tach because they are
economy packages?).  Drivers who regularly drive different cars, or
cars with different gearing setups, must develop strategies for
remembering these things.

By-the-way, you have surely noticed that one can set the gear ratios in
GT in inappropriate orders.  I.e. set 3rd to be lower than 2nd.  Or
does something notice before you try and save it?  I should try that
sometime.  When I get bored of trying to finish in each position in
each of the spot races, or something.  8-)

Hey.  That would be good.  A page of silly things like that (try to
finish in each position in each spot race) to try when you're feeling
bored or frustrated with Gran Turismo.  I guess "try driving a car
with badly order-gear ratios" might be another.  Hmm... Perhaps it
does notice because what would that do to its automatic gear
shifting algorithms?  Aaa... It woulD probably just end up more-or-less
skipping the bad gear.

I did the experiment, and confirmed that, for the High Speed Ring,

6th:   Cr100

Note that I waited later and later to lose, that's why the winning times
get faster and I am closer in time to the winner for 4th than 2nd.
I think.

I'm pretty sure the prize money is the same for all Spot Races.

Following pole time observations:
My pole          Runner-up
58.246            +14.590
58.342            +14.064
58.130            +14.284
58.229            +14.219

Never did deliberately lose the pole and see what times the winner
got.

I won the Toyota Lancer LM edition.  (Not difficult, but...)
It has a strange burble in its accelleration.  It doesn't seem to
occur at a constant engine speed.  Another thing I've noticed is that
Vipers and Corvettes behave as if they have a first gear rev limiter
limiting them to 6000rpm.  But in the IA-2 test (SS R5 with a Viper)
the exact properties of that apparent limit seemed to vary.
Bah.  IA-1 was fairly easy, but I've got a long way to go for IA-2.

In arcade I'm down to Deep Forest "B" as the only red dot remaining to
get.  I've switched to the Soarer in my attempts.  I had been leaving
Trial Mountain till last, but was getting so frustrated with Deep
Forest that I went to try my luck at Trial Mountain.  The Impreza won A
after a few warm-up attempts.  Next I tried the trusty Civic, and won C
after two or three races.  And then the Eclipse won B on my first
attempt with it.  I think Trial Mountain had seemed so hard at Normal
that I'd learned where to squeeze speed out in the process.  And there
was the A-license test which helped set up for the hilly straight,
too.  The computer cars take completely the wrong line through the
esses before the finish.  I took advantage of so many sneaky tricks
that my cornering onto the penultimate straight was still unpracticed
enough that I often, even usually, ended up going on the grass.  In
addition to the final esses, and the turns before the uphill straight,
another place one squeezes speed out of Trial Mountain is the first
series of corners after the start.  You start turning early into turn 1
(red/white rumble strip thing on your right side gives a big hint
when), and can take that series of turns up to the tunnel really fast.

In fact, as general hint to driving Gran Turismo, many corners seem to
be taken best if you start cornering as soon as you see the
red-and-white rumble strip on the outside.  And, even if one learns to
do better, those strips make excellent reference points.  But the
perspective is such that some corners, e.g. turn 1 at Trial Mountain,
(also the turn into the tunnel on Grand Valley East) do not visually
seem relevant as early as they really are, and you can use the rumble
strips to make up for that.

Along similar lines, I did see somewhere that the "Eunos" is the

that "Miata" was more catchy, but the game didn't pick up on the
North American name.

I tried the Normal Car Race with a Cerbera.  Like starting all over

Don't worry about it.

I tend to rattle on too much.

Some of it borders on rhetorical questions, others I might pore over
later if I ever decide to create some sort of driving advice pages.
("Gran Turismo for the Complete Klutz", or something, maybe?  8-)

That use of the handbrake to force a clutch pop suggestion you "hmm'd"
about works really well, though.  As does upshifting to prevent a
spinout.  But, by the time you've got the car that close to a spin
you've already lost a lot of time--probably too much for any advanced
series.

So, if you do work on replies to my email, concentrate on correcting
any gross misconceptions you notice.

To: albrnick@bobcat.ent.ohiou.edu
Subject: Finally achieved Hi-Res GT mode
Status: R

As you may recall, the last red dot I needed to get was Deep Forest Racing
Way "B".  I finally did it last night (early this morning actually).

I used the Toyota Soarer.  I finally realized that I was shifting it too
late.  By shifting earlier I could get more speed up that backstretch
(the curving straight on the varied tarmac through the two tunnels).
This allowed me to pass computer cars there, and pass the leader on
the turn coming out of the second tunnel.

The time I won with (1:28.xx) was not my fastest (I did 1:26 a few times
before changing my shifting strategy). 

But the trouble seems to be that if you are leading, the computer cars
get really mad and start driving really fast, and bashing past on the
inside, etc.  Since they do occasionally miscalculate turns and end up
losing time on the grass, it can be the case that they go by on your
inside "too fast", and use you to slow themselves down.  In the process,
of course, your car gets messed up one way or another.  You either slow
down too much, or go off onto the grass, or both.

So the key to winning in arcade mode seems to be a strong finish.  On
Deep Forest Racing Way you need to get the last corner just right so
you exit fast and right on the outside edge.  The time I won the
second place car actually did rear-end me but did not attempt to pass.

Most other courses have easier ways for a human to achieve a strong
finish.  Trial Mountain has that esse that the computer cars take
completely wrong, for instance.  And Grand Valley has the diddly
hairpin esse where all sorts of fun things can be done.  But the last
corner on Deep Forest Racing Way seems to suit the computer
algorithms better than people.

Another observation I've made is that different fields of cars behave
very differently.  The cars are automatons.  If you keep retrying with
the same field, if you drive the same line, they will make the same
movements.  After a few sessions you can use this to determine how to
get to the front early.  To win, you seem to need to get near to the
front, but should not lead the entire way.  You need to get to the
front to keep the cars grouped close together, but they get too vicious
if you stay out in front, so you want them close together so you can
drop back and pass towards the finish.  Until I discovered the proper
shift pattern for the Soarer, however, I did not think I could pass
close enough to the finish.  But eventually when I won, I pass the
second place car for the last time just coming out of the last tunnel.

In some fields of cars, one car consistently zooms to the front and
stays there.  I don't think one should persist with such a field.
(Or I shouldn't, anyway).  You seem to have a better chance in a
field where lead among the other cars changes consistently.

Are white computer cars always fastest?  At times it seems so.

Naw.  The connection was that "Eunos" is a name I think they don't and
wouldn't use in North America, just like "Fairlady".  Anyone who gives
text descriptions of the cars should mention "Miata" when talking about
the Eunos.  In fact, that must be where I got the information from.

Actually, searching altavista, I think "Eunos/Miata" is  mentioned in
the B-class final hints.

I happened to notice that you give stock weight for the Cerbera as "2452",
whereas in fact it is "2425".  OTOH, that weight reduction still does
not give 0.145 ratio (quite; I make .1443).
One alternative would be to not store the PTW ratios at all.  Just
calculate them on the fly each time.
The Griffith error is quite dramatic.  That's what caused me to
investigate further.

I also notice you don't have the Maxed figures for the Demio Aspec  
prize car   8-).

As soon as I won my second Demio I started hopping it up.  I'll have
to max one for you and let you know the results.  Nothing quite as
funny as a racing Demio.

Well, this weekend I won several of the nifty prize cars, by doing the
international series.

The first time I tried the UKversusJapan, with my race modified
(Castrolized?) Cerbera, I lost to an absolutely identical-looking
Cerbera.  This is the first time I have seen the computer generate
an identical opponent in a series, although I think occasionally
back in my days of Spot Races another red Supra MA70 would show up.
But that's not as distinctive as the two-tone racing Cerbera.

Eventually I got my footing, and the Cerbera won a Cerbera.  (green).
Winning that car is the object of the game, isn't it?  It sure seems
like it.  Before driving it, I think I humiliated myself with the
Viper in the Normal Car series.  I humiliated myself with several
cars in the Normal Car series last weekend.  But I remember driving
the Cerbera and thinking "this car is on rails"; I think that was
partly because of the comparison with the Normal Car series.  I
managed to get the Viper to third in the Normal Car series, but
other attempts (Griffith, Impreza Mitsubishi GTO 4WD) failed
miserably.  Notice how the Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo series of
cars say "276bhp" on the showroom, but "311bhp" after you've bought
them?  A nice change from the Subarus which seem to lose about
6bhp after you buy them.

I wish there was a series with cars of the same caliber as the Normal
Car Series, but which had shorter races.  One observation of the Normal
Car series which I did make with the Griffith on the Mini Ring was that
the cars do not try hard to keep you lapped.  (I spun out early and got
lapped on lap 4, but got back ahead and the leader stayed behind).

In addition, I wish there was a series of 5 lap races which was not
as intense as the Normal Car Series.  Doing the Normal Car Series
can literally give me a headache.

I used the prize Cerbera, I think, to win the UK versus US series,
winning the green Castrol RX7.  (Seems ironic, since it's neither
American nor English).  I brought out the 900hp Skyline to win the
Japan vs US series, winning a white Viper with blue stripes.  It's good
to have a couple of Vipers in your garage.  To vipe your vindshield.

I think acceleration burbling, noticeable in all LM cars, and large
American cars, may be the game punishing you for not warming up
properly before the start.  I now think dutifully doing that warm up
may be essential to really good license times, etc.  I.e. presumably
the game punishes you, albeit less dramatically, even with less
powerful cars.  I did a silver time for B-8, that leaves only B-3 at
bronze.  I discovered you *can* do a bronze B-3 (Deep Forest Haipin)
without brakes, but am not sure how that info relates to doing a really
fast time.  I think B-3 is the hardest B test both to get silver, and
even to get bronze, and I'm not sure that's great game design, since
it can make for early discouragement.  I suppose it's a relief when
the other tests are easier.  And you are allowed to take them early,
so...

Silly stuff I did included taking the prize Cerbera to put some
decent records on the Spot Races.  I guess they are easier than
the Sunday Cup, in terms of times, but I think the other cars
in the Sunday Cup try a little harder to let you win if you
are close.  The silliest thing was when I took the 900hp Skyline
to the High Speed Ring Spot Race, and got the pole even after
spinning out on the last corner when qualifying.  So I did the
race over, and demolished the records nicely.  Slightly less
silly was taking this thoroughbred racing machine to sweep the
FR series.  It's fun setting decent track records, but I wish
they were accessible without entering the series.  Also, the info
from other series should be available in all series.

Speaking of letting you win.  I took the prize Cerbera to the UK/Japan
series, trying to win for a second time.  I thought I was going to
lose.  I forgot where I was on Trial Mountain II and wiped out badly on
the tricky sharp left-hander.  I never recovered, finishing 6th.  I
cleaned up okay on SS R5 and HSR.  But then I was doing nicely at GVE
II, but a little worried about the guy right behind me, who wasn't a
contender anyway, so I lost control on the very last hairpin.  I didn't
spin, but went off into the gravel, and lost 4 positions finishing
5th.  So, the series leading RX7 has 22 points to my 21 going into the
dreaded SS R11.  Even the fact it has so few points is an indication
they try to help you win.

Anyway, on R11 I have my usual share of minor disasters for that
course.  Attempting to go slowly through that awful chicane and getting
spun around by a rear-ending computer car (they have impeccable night
vision, of course) usually happens at least once.  But I keep
soldiering on, having learned a reasonable rhythm for the first set of
twiddlies after turn 2 (the sharpish one with the red barriers) which
allows me to keep picking off the opposition.  Now I noticed the RX7
poking around a little near the back of the pack.  That's good, I
thought.  I just need to finish with one car between him and me, and I
get two more points and can win the series without even winning the
race.   I manage to stay calm, and even take second on the finishing
straight, and sure enough, I win the series.  The RX7 finished 5th
in the race.

But I win an identical Cerbera.  Not even a purple one.  But, being
a millionaire now  8-), I don't bother selling the car, but keep it
for reference.  (I.e. settings).  If I win a purple one, I guess
I'll sell this second green one.  Or maybe I'll just donate it to
the Salvation Army.  The tax deduction should be worth more than
what the TVR dealer will give me.

Probably some weekend I'll take my million and use it to "borrow" the
$500K Special Models (ie. test drive them, but not save the game).

Actually, one would think you could take cars for a test-drive without
buying them; perhaps to the test centre and to Autumn Mini time trial.
(results could be not saved unless you actually own the car).  But
perhaps that's a North American culture thing.  Perhaps in Japan you
buy cars without test driving them.  Of course, they'd have to
decide whether you could test drive cars you didn't have the money
for.   8-)  Actually I did do some test-driving when trying to
compare 4wd Normal Cars (in vain, of course), since I didn't want too
many in my garage and/or to donate too much to the Auto Dealers'
Charity.  Way back when I first started playing the game I did one set
of several days using a Toyota Corolla Levin which I never saved.
After that I bought a Supra MA70 which is apparently one of the good
choices.  So I guess one does have a test drive option, but it is
a hassle.

You list the pole time for High Speed Ring I as "0:41.731".

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/races/megaspeed_cup.html

Now, this happens to be identical to the reasonable value you give
for the Autumn Ring Mini II in

http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/races/normal_car_world_speed_contest.html

So I suspect incorrectly transcribed the former, since it seems about
10 seconds too fast.  I can believe someone somewhere set such a time
for this event on High Speed Ring I.  But, as far as I can tell, your
"Pole times" are an estimate of the time required for the player to be
guaranteed pole.

Pole times for Megaspeed Cup seem to be easier to get as event
progresses, so I think required time is somewhere around 51 seconds,
versus the 56 which is easy enough to beat in the other direction.

Actually, in several of the series the races seem to get easier as you
move through the series, as if they've tuned the game for "come from
behind" excitement.  A big exception, right now, seems to be the
several series which end with SSR11, but it feels like perhaps that
track is just difficult to learn, and the competition is not
difficult, per se.  (Except for their night-vision advantage).
Besides, you've often got the series wrapped up by then, anyway.  8-)

Minor typo in

                 ^

There is an advantage in your small pages for these races, but if they
were all tags on a large page, one could easily search for patterns,
scroll up and down, and compare, etc.  This making the table of
contents
( http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/simulation/races/index.html
is essentially a table of contents) a pointer into a single largish
document, or even the same document, is a fairly standard Web trick
for allowing tree access and flat-space scanning at the same time.

Each page is only about 5k, so total would be only about 100K or less.
Maintaining both chopped up and contiguous version would be a pain,
unless you derived them both from a single source form.

That last thought is probably just something to think about for future
pages.  I mean, maybe you even thought about it for this one and
rejected it...

I made the max figures for the Demio A spec prize car  211bhp, 1210lb.

I got:
12.755 400m
22.500 1000m
163mph max speed (using my clockwise running technique)
latter with gears of  4.400
                      1.810
                      1.155
                      0.900
                      0.800
                    fd3.200

At one point I overgeared it so badly that shifting to fifth slowed
it down.  8-)

160mph is the practical maximum; you can eek above that with a close
pair of top gears, and run out of power and straight about the same
time.  I could believe someone could coax 165 to 167 out of it.

Anyway, I took this baby to the Sunday Cup.

Autumn Mini   pole:  1st 43.900 (-2.208)
              race:  1st 1:21.025 (-1.x)  0:40.893 0:40.132

Not sure what drugs I was on for that first lap, wish I could ingest
them for my IA time trials.  I think I stayed on the track all
the time, but, of course, a lot of time was spent on two wheels.
This Demio really wishes to be a motorcycle.


HS Ring      pole: 1st 1:10.221 (-4.561)
                            (I lost 3 secs not paying attention at start!!!)
             race: 1st 2:04.627 (-5.518) 1:06.710  0:57.917
                            (See I told you I lost 3 seconds)

GVE          pole: 1st 1:12.288 (-11.128)
             race: 1st 2:16.329 (-9.933)  1:11.252 1:05.077

I used "-S.XXX" to indicate the distance to next competitor, similar
to TT ghost reporting.  Er, no.  Maybe I do have it backwards.
Doesn't matter, I think you know what I mean.

So the Demio went out and won itself another Demio!!!  (Which, of
course, I promptly sold).

I finally got silver in B-3 license test.  I never fail that test
now unless I make a gross mistake, or a bad experiment.  I can't
reproduce the silver, but when I did it, I braked entirely with tire
action and engine, and I stayed in the middle of the track approaching
the turn so I could turn outwards to rock the car into it.  The action
seems to work.  It's interesting being able to make repeated runs,
try slightly different lines and actions, see times vary, but nearly
always come in under the required bronze 30 seconds.  Staying in the
middle of the track, of course, avoids losing acceleration, as well.

I got 28.466 (silver was 28.500).  I notice the demo did slightly
better at 28,448, but, unlike most demos, that demo is not a gold medal
run.  (Gold is 28.150)

It's interesting to speculate how much of one's improvement relative to
the past is due to learning the PSX interface (I'm not sure when I
switched to my Barracuda 2 controller, for instance), and how much
is due to learning driving techniques.  (And a little comes from
learning somewhat silly nuances of the game).

The Barracuda 2 is nice and adult-sized, and has a noticeable dead
zone in the centre of the analog sticks.  That has advantages and
disadvantages, of course.

For the souped-up Demio, even though it had relatively poor low-speed
torque, the handbrake would not keep the clutch out.  Strange.

The trick works flawlessly with other cars.  They actually won't
go anywhere until you release the handbrake.  But not with the
Demio.  It hops forward against the handbrake, and then comes
close to stalling.
