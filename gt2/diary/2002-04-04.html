I'm sure I read somone else say what I'm about to say about
<b>V-Rally 2</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The only two cars you need to use are the <b>Nissan Micra</b> and
the <b>Audi Quattro</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I kept a reasonably complete log this time, so can verify my strategies
and results.  The log was on paper, not computer, so I can't right now
share it directly with you  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  but eventually maybe I will type it in!  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The <b>Nissan Micra</b> seems to have a good combination of ease
of driving speed, and handicap evaluation in the game.  That is, the
opponents go slower for the <b>Nissan Micra</b> than they do for, say,
the <b>Peugeot 106</b>.  It seems fairly easy to use it to win the
first six events (all except the <b>Expert</b> events).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The <b>Nissan</b> has quite a hard time, however, in the <b>Expert</b>
events, but if you have finished the <b>World Trophy</b> you will have
unlocked the <b>Audi Quattro</b>.  So the <b>Audi Quattro</b> is good
to use for those.  It demolishes the <b>Trophy</b> and <b>Championship</b>
events, although the <b>Expert Arcade</b> event, with its tricky time
limits, is a little harder.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
But one thing I wanted to do in my game was finish with less than 10,000
points and not win the <b>Peugeot 405 T16</b>.  The <b>Nissan Micra</b>
helped with that because its is slow, but I wasted time when I could.
For instance, in Championships you can completely throw all events after
you have enough points to clinch it.  (That is when the number of events
remaining times 10 is less than the difference between your score and
that of the second place AI car).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In fact, in the <b>Expert Championship</b> after I had finished 9 of 12
races and had a 40 point lead, I drove the remaining three races so 
slowly (about 12 minutes total each) that my time was well over the
72 minutes requires to show up in the Championship total time record.
Although I won with 83 points to 61, my time registered as 59:59:59
even though it was over 72 minutes.  The game actually gave me no
performance points; when I checked the records for earlier individual
rallies they had not registered either.  It's possible the fact I
had reloaded the series a couple of times caused the individual rally
records to be lost, but I don't think I've seen that happen before.
Oh well, that helped me easily finish the game with less than 10,000 points.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I had only 4021 points, and then got to 5977 after winning the <b>Expert
Trophy</b> (I still threw a bit of time there, too, once I got a
sufficient lead).  I then entered the <b>Expert Arcade</b> with the
<b>Audi Quattro</b> which can be difficult, but I was getting used to
the tricky parts of the tracks and how to meet all the checkpoints.
I was even able to win most of the rallies which helps since you get
an extra "credit" or retry for every win.  I took only one try to
win with the <b>Audi Quattro</b>, using up only 2 or 3 credits
(2 at Monte Carlo, and maybe 1 at Indonesia).  I had then finished all
9 of 9 events and got 9 of 10 prize cars with 6749 points--a long way
from the 10,000 necessary to win the <b>Peugeot 405 T16</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
After later redoing the <b>Expert Championship</b>, the <b>World
Championship</b> and <b>Arcade Level 1</b> I got 10006 points and won
the <b>Peugeot 405 T16</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
And so, although I did a bit of fooling around trying to avoid getting
the 10,000 points, this still indicates a quick way to finish <b>V-Rally
2</b> once you have sufficiently mastered the courses.  The important
thing in all courses is to remember all the tricky bits and learn how
to use the proper amount of minimal caution to get through them, and
then try and go as fast as possible for the other parts.
