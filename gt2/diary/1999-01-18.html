My wife&amp;I rented PSX games "Formula 1" (original; 1994-1995), and
"Andretti Racing" over the weekend.

Formula 1 is very playable in easy arcade mode (damage off  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">, and I
like the depiction of Monaco.  Murray Walker, OBE's excited commentary
about you hitting the barrier all the time is quite fun too.  Normal
arcade mode was still winnable, and hard seemed very hard the once I
tried it.  I never tried the simulation "Grand Prix" mode.

My wife doesn't like the Formula 1 graphics (compared to Gran Turismo),
but I thought they were adequate.  Some details of perspective and
view were better in Formula 1 than Gran Turismo.  One big problem
in Gran Turismo is that any corner more than 90 degrees does not
look that long until you begin going around it.  You need to look
at the map or learn how the corner acts to compensate.  Formula 1
did not have this problem.  TrU still had some of those old Formula 1
games for $29.95 yesterday.  We might have bought it to share
with you and your son, but my wife does not like the graphics.  But I
think they're fine.  Perhaps you can check for yourself.  See below.

Andretti Racing was a litle worse.  The stock cars look like
cockroaches.  But one fun thing was that it had a Toronto track
complete with Prince's gates, Coliseum, bridges over the Lakeshore, and
a few other Ex buildings.  We couldn't spot the CN tower, though.
Perspective was quite bad.  As you approached a corner you basically
saw just the wall ahead of you.  Though that is a function of the track
having wall all around.  Some other tracks were a little different.  It
also has video interviews with Mario, Michael and Jeff Andretti.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
Oh yes, it was quite hard to do well on a twisty track, although easy
to do well on the Australian high-banked oval.

I recorded a demo of these two games on the VCR.  My wife might bring you
the tape when she comes.  I recorded Monaco and Montreal from Formula
1; thought you might recognize some Montreal scenery.  From Andretti
I recorded Toronto and the high-banked oval.

Unfortunately, neither of the games recognize dual shocks.  Andretti is
very good as far as controller configuration goes, allows user to map
any button to any function.  Formula 1 restricts you to a choice of 8
pre-configured set ups.  They steer reasonably naturally with the
directional pad, and playing them didn't seem to mess up my feel for
Gran Turismo.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  The steering model is almost like variable ratio.
If you're going full speed down the straight, a lot of directional
presses changes you very little.  But actually, I think directional
response may vary with track position in addition to speed.  I.e.
it knows where the corners are and "helps" you around them.
