<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I dug out my <b>V-Rally 2</b> game save again, and went on to finish it.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Getting on for two years ago now, I had completed much, but not
all of it.  I had unlocked all levels except for the top level
of trophy, and used the 10,000 point bonus to gain
the "cheat" prize car (Peugeot 405 T16).  That is, I had four levels yet to complete;
expert level of all three modes, as well as the intermediate ("World") level
of trophy mode.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Well, I took it out of retirement and fairly quickly and methodically
finished it up, completing the expert arcade mode last night.  Playing
<b>Ducati World Racing Challenge</b> had helped.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In fact, I now realize that <b>Gran Turismo</b> is in many ways very
easy.  When initially playing the demo, so many years ago now,
I had trouble keeping the car pointing forward.  However, once you learn
that basic skill it then seems <b>Gran Turismo</b> is tolerant of quite
a lot of sloppiness.  Penalties for missed braking spots, etc. tend not
to be severe and the physics model gives lots of feed back and room
for recovery.  The mere fact that you cannot roll the car helps an
immense amount.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In contrast, in <b>V-Rally 2</b> and <b>Ducati World Racing Challenge</b>
a total wipe-out is a common occurrence.  To do well you must drive
cautiously but quickly.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Eventually, too, I caught on to the fact that in <b>V-Rally 2</b> your
navigator is none too reliable.  He makes mistakes.  Quite consistently,
if two corners are joined by a jog, the navigator never announces the
jog.  So learning all the places where these occur is very important to
arranging to keep control on the courses, even though, in general the
navigation cues are helpful.  (Okay, so the navigator is reliable in
that he makes the same mistakes on the same courses all the time).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
When I restarted the game I went after the intermediate trophy level
("World Trophy") right away, using the Peugeot T16.  I methodically
won it.  I then went on to the Expert Trophy, and won that too.  In both
cases I did not actually reload the trophy to win it, but won legitimately
in a single try.  An interesting point, though, is that my World Trophy
total time was not as low as the record time I had previously set???
In any case, I had now won the <b>Audi Quattro</b>, arguably a better
all-round car than the <b>T16</b>.  So combining some of my now-acquired
cautious driving technique with the "save-and-reload" trick for the
Expert Championship, I finished that using the <b>Quattro</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
That left only Expert Arcade Mode, which I found tricky to finish.  It is so
frustrating to be only a second or so late for your checkpoint and
therefore lose.  I initially tried using the <b>Audi Quattro</b> for
that series, and its smoother feel did help me learn my way around the
tracks, but to get right to the end it seemed to help to use the <b>T16</b>.
I mean, when I finished the last <b>Indonesia</b>, it was on my last replay
chance ("credit").
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I had acquired over 14000 "performance points" at that point.  You get a
point for each second's worth of records you achieve.  I made a mistake,
actually, early in the game by earning 400 points with another driver.
That is not a good thing to do, since one driver must win 10,000 points
in order to get the <b>T16</b>.
