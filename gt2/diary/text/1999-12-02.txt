And now I win the gold medal for B-5

Threads:
  License Test Progress

It took me several days, but not quite as many attempts or as
dedicated an effort, and I finally broke through to win the gold
medal for B-5 (the GTO twinturbo at the same course).

I still found it harder than I thought it would be.  I had set
23.690 (23.650 is the target) previously, and soon managed
23.680 after I began trying again, but after that never broke
23.700 until I finally won the gold medal.

When I did the gold medal, I won by the largest margins so far!
(Counting only my four "real" gold medals).  My time was 23.590
a full .060 under the required 23.650!

The car was a little bit loose during the first part of the turn, and
the speed appeared to dip to about 60mph, though that may be only the
measured wheel speed; perhaps the car went a bit faster because of
sideways drift.  Whereas the demo drops down only to 3rd gear, I
dropped all the way to 2nd.

Then I tried B-6 (only it and B-8 remain in my B tests).  B-6 is the
Mitsubishi FTO GP version R at the High Speed Ring esses, and I did set
a new silver time (ie. personal best) twice, but am still about .125
over the gold goal of 26.350.
