Would you believe I collected the race prize cars a second time?

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

For the last two or three weeks I spent a lot of time completing a
second game from scratch, in which I collected all the race prize cars
in as short a time (in terms of simulation days) as I was able.

It took me longer than I expected, but today I eventually
did finish.


A detailed log of this is at

Significantly, I did not race any simulation races in the game,
nor even do any time trials.  You will notice I enter races
redundantly in the superstitious (but not unfounded) belief
that it helps "unlock" new prize cars.
