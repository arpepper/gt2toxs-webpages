I set new PB with ConceptCar in SSR11 All-Night I in platinum game

In the <html><a href="logs/platinum">platinum</a></html> game the
purple ConceptCar easily won the All-night I Event, and I set a
new Personal Best time in the process.

Details will be filled in later...
===============================================================================
Well, the big question in my <html><a href="logs/platinum">platinum</a></html>
game was deciding how much the Impreza could win.  The only Mega-fast,
non-racing-spec car you can guarantee to win is the silver Nismo GT-R
LM from the All-nightII (tuned all-night race at SSR11) race.  So, I
thought I would use the Impreza to win that.

The prize Impreza did a reliable job of winning the All-nightII.

Wow, that was almost precisely 10 seconds a lap slower, 300 seconds
or 5 minutes in total, slower than the GTO'95MR, yet I still lapped
the field.

I led from start to finish, and began lapping the slowish field by
lap 11.  I had lapped all but one of them by my second pit stop on
lap 16 (not all of those stuck).  It was nice to be able to easily take
3 instead of 4 pit stops.  In this race I noticed a substantial
penalty when I encountered traffic--it seemed to consistently cost
me 4 seconds or more on those laps.

My third pit stop was quite exciting.  I had just lapped a car before
pulling into the pits.   As I was in the pits, that car came in after
I did, and stopped up ahead of me.  I saw it go up on its "jacks",
and then go down, and take off before my car had even started!  And
it did not seem to obey the same pit lane speed limit I am forced to!
Talk about AI cheating!

I won Cr150,000, and the silver Nismo GT-R LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...

Thread: Gameplay Hints

Since the object is to avoid buying any other cars, but collect all the
gold cups with prize cars only from now on, I cannot use my GTO'95MR
wins All-NightI, and Silvia wins GV300 strategy.  I had won a yellow
Skyline in the Tuned (Abnormal) Series with the Impreza, but, although
I maxed it and won the Mega Speed Event, I did not want to rely on it
either, since I wanted to develop a strategy to get all gold cups
buying only a Civic and a Viper, and winning all other cars.

The only Mega-fast, non-racing-spec car you can guarantee to win is the
silver Nismo GT-R LM from the All-nightII (tuned all-night race at
SSR11) race.  And I did manage to use the Impreza to win that.  After I
complete the game I will evaluate the tuned prize Nismo at the Mega
Speed Event, and perhaps even the All-nightI.

The results from the All-nightII indicate that I probably
cannot win the All-nightI with the Impreza.  It would be tough to win
the Japanese International Series with it too, so I decided to start
with the Chaser LM in the UKvsJP Series (it usually seems easier than
the USvsJP Series).

With the Chaser LM, I manage to win all five races of the UKvsJP
Series, although I qualified 6th at Trial Mountain, and also only
fourth at the High Speed Ring, and fourth again at Grand Valley East
ii.  To my diappointment I won a black del Sol LM again.  8-(  Oh well,
it should be good enough to win USvsJP, and one or both of the Grand
Valley 300 and the All-NightI as well.  But I wish I could win a
Cerbera LM in one of these "fast" games.   Perhaps the problem is that
I buy no British cars in these games--that does not seem to stop me
from winning the DB7, though.

The Chaser LM does need patience, care, practise, and a little tuning
in order to be able to win that series.  I used its setting from the
<html><a href="1999-09-18.html#Tuning_Advice">Grand Valley 300</a></html>,
although for most of the races I used stabilizers of 3 instead of 4.
