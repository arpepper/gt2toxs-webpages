(GT2)  Evolution of a GameShark Code, Part III

Threads:
 Gran Turismo 2
 Game Shark Hints

I wanted to create a GameShark Code for <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html> which
would cause you to win as prize cars hybrids constructed from your garage.
These codes will only possibly work for <html><b>GameShark Version 3.00</b>
or higher.

In the first two step, outlined in my previous two entries , I developed codes
to cause you to win as a prize-car a new copy of the first car in your
garage--first a single copy, and later as components.

The next step, was to copy different pieces of the car from different
garage slots.  That, then, would be the first version of this code of
mine.

The first version is for the
original 1.0 North American version of <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html>:

I have worked extensively with this 1.0 code.

I have not actually tested any of the other versions, yet.  I would expect
them to work, and would not be greatly afraid to try them--I just have
not got around to it.

For North American Version 1.1:

So this is actually the code I wanted!!!

With the code active, arrange that six cars you want to combine, as
indicated, are at the top of your garage.  Often you want to have
duplicate copies of cars if there are only certain things you want
to combine.  In an extreme case, you might put five copies of a BMW
in the first five slots, and put a car with nice after-market rims
in the sixth slot, and then your prize will be the BMW fitted with
the custom rims.

I did not totally like my choice of parts combinations (in particular
dangerous things happen when you mix the L+W+H code inappropriately, so
I find it best to keep it with the "base" car; it makes for a more
realistic hybrid that way, anyway.

So, in my next version, I tweak things a bit, rearranging the parts,
and actually use nine slots instead of six.

A caveat applies to all these codes.  I think they strain the limits
of the <html><b>GameShark</b></html>, and about once every 20 or so attempts,
I get a dreaded <html><b>No Name No Name</b></html> car instead of the
desired hybrid.  Often this happens twice in a row, and then tends to
clear up.  I think it is a timing problem, aggravated perhaps by the
length of my code, or, perhaps, I think I heard once, by the fact I
have so many codes now for <html><b>Gran Turismo 2</b></html>, even though
most of them are not active.
