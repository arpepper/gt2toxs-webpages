In the <html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/nismo">nismo</a></html> game I
used the Nismo 400R as much as possible, so I entered the
race-modified version in the Grand Valley 300.  This was
after playing <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font> almost
exclusively for about eight months.  I was surprised but
glad to see that my <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html>
skill seemed to have generally improved.

I had a bad first corner, but regained the lead soon after that, 
holding it until the finish, in a fairly uneventful race.

This was only a little slower than the Cerbera LM, and once again I
lapped the field four, not quite five, times.  I think I would have
done slightly better with one more pit stop, too.

I lapped the field by lap 14, just before my first pit stop.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

This is slightly slower than my record with the Cerbera LM, and also
slightly slower than the <html><em>first</em></html> time I managed with
the Concept Car.  This may, however, be the only car other than the
Concept Car with which I have done sub 1:30 laps during a Grand Valley
300.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 60 lap times...
