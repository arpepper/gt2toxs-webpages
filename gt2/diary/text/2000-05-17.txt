(GT2 Version 1.1)  GameShark Info about the Toyota New Car Lot

There has been interest in a V1.1 Toyota Prize Showroom Code, but
I have not had the inclination to test the complete version of
that code.  As far as I am concerned, there are few reasons for
actually playing the 1.1 version of the game; it still has the Garage
Delete bug, but no longer has the Vector LM at the Trial Mountain
Enduro.   8-)

Perhaps I will get around to testing a complete code, but in the
meantime, here is a transcription of my notes on the addresses
of the Toyota Page 1 new cars in North
American <html><font color="red">Gran</font> <font color="blue">Turismo</font></html> 2, version 1.1

(80)1C2E2C - car being reviewed for purchase

That is the address used in the "Buy Anywhere" code.

(80)1C30D8 - car slot #1 (top left)

76 bytes with each slot, mostly zeroes

Although an argument could be made for slot ordering:

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
   1   2
   3   4
   5   6
   7   8
</pre>
</HTML>

The most natural numbering for me, and what I have assumed is:

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
   1   5
   2   6
   3   7
   4   8
</pre>
</HTML>

After all, manufacturers with fewer than five new cars on a page
tend to put them in a column.

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
 (80)1C308C - Page 1, B,L (4)
 (80)1C30D8 - Page 1, T,L  (1)
 (80)1C3124 - Page 1, T,R  (5)
 (80)1C3170 - Page 1, T+1,L  (2)
 (80)1C31BC - Page 1, T+1,R  (6)
 (80)1C3208 - Page 1, T+2,R  (7)
 (80)1C3254 - Page 1, T+2,L  (3)
 (80)1C32EC - Page 1, B,R  (8)  Note the different displacement
</pre>
</HTML>

This gives the rather strange apparent fill-in order for the slots of:

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
   2   3
   4   5
   7   6
   1   8
</pre>
</HTML>

It's not impossible I made an error in my notes.

A short V1.1 Purchase code is 

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
 D01C32EC D5D8
 801C30D8 D758
 D01C32EC D5D8
 801C30DA 120D
</pre>
</HTML>
