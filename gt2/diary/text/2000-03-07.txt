I took an old two-forty, and I played a little dirty,<br>And I beat the bloody Vector at the Tri-al Mountain Thirty!

Thanks for all and any websites of Game Shark help!

I managed to hybrid a Diahatsu Midget weight and (more importantly)
a Cerbera LM motor onto a race-mod 1971 Datsun 240Z, already fitted
with NA3, displacement increase, balance and polishing (I think it
was NA3; just squeaks in under 295bhp).  I discovered that if you
do the engine patch, and then enter the Trial Mountain 30, the "race
stewards" don't notice that you are over-power.  This is in version 1.0,
but then that's the only one where the Vector shows up, I think...

While you can certainly feel the power, it goes away if you do settings
(but strangely comes back if you exit and re-enter another event or
machine test).  Initially I thought maybe I could put a small motor on
a Cerbera LM, and patch it back to normal once entered, but that does
not seem to work.  Even though the garage says 22bhp, and the Cerbera
has trouble going 60mph, it still is not allowed to enter the Trial
Mountain 30.  That gave me the hint that doing the opposite sort of mod
should work.

The garage claimed 1119lb and 1119bhp for the hybrid 240Z.  It felt
plausible.  I made reasonably heavy use of the LSD settings, but
patched in no extra aero, and, all-in-all, this must be one very
well-balanced car.  8-) Initially I tried weight-reduction only, but
got inconclusive results.  (Perhaps partly because of going to the
settings menu...)

My time was not great, I was learning the car as I drove, and didn't
tune it optimally--just verified it was going fast enough.  I did
41:39.957, and the Vector did 42:37.782

Strange thing is that previous Vector times I observed were 44:07.381
and 44:09.006--it *does* go faster if you do.  (Not totally
unrealistic, really, but different, I'm fairly sure, from GT1; it would
be annoying if it turned out I could beat it with, say, a 43:00 minute
time, though, and various things suggest to me that would be the case).

I don't suppose I'll do a lot of hybridding, but I probably will try
and create a 142bhp Impreza Wagon.   8-)  ('cos that's what I drive
in real life   8-)  And in the back of my mind I'll be trying to
find if there's another hp evaluation in the garage which could be
patched on, say, the Cerbera LM to make the race stewards think it
was below 295bhp, while still feeling like 624 to me.   8-)
