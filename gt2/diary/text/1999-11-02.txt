In the directory <a href="logs">logs</a> I keep several logs of
some of my interesting games; the directory now has a sort of
interesting form on it that lets you find out what the garage
for each game looked like on different days.  This is most
interesting in the <a href="logs/blue">blue</a> game.
</p>
<p>
The most recent game I have completed is the <a href="logs/gold">gold</a>
game in which I won all the gold race cups in 100 days of simulation
mode.

<p>
Another interesting facility I have created is my
<a href="../inventory/findcar.html">findcar</a> facility which allows
you to search for cars matching desired characteristics.
