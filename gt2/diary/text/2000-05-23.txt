I Simply Remember My Favourite Cars...

Someone's email got me thinking.  I don't really have a favourite car
in <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="white">2</font></html>. 
In <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font>1</html>
the Cerbera LM was definitely my favourite (with the purple or yellow
Concept Car reserved for record-setting).

But last night I tried a
certain  <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="white">2</font></html>
prize car for the first time, and was very
impressed.  The car was the STP Taisan Viper.  I'm not much of a Viper
fan (although I found a race-mod Viper GTS a good standby
in <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font>1</html>;
lighter, and therefore better power-to-weight than the prize GTS-R).
It was quite easy to sweep the GT500 with the Taisan Viper, although I
had a little trouble at Trial Mountain.  (Maybe I should have raised
the height above the default 85mm  8-) ).  One thing I did do, based on
recent experience with the ZZ-II, was raise the aero in proportion
rather than setting both to the max.  (With both the ZZ-II and this
Viper, not only are the ranges for front and rear aero different, the
default front setting is actually visually lower than the rear).

With <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font>1</html>,
a "game" (all trophies once) was short enough that I could
finish it in a week or two.  This is not the case
in <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="white">2</font></html>
So I can't
really do multiple games and see which cars I gravitate towards.  And,
if you follow the spirit of the race requirements, you need a lot more
cars
in 
in <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="white">2</font></html>
than <html><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">T</font>1</html>,
making it difficult to stick with favourites.

I used to think the Tuscan Speed 6 was my favourite.  And I guess I
still sort of think so, as long as I don't race-mod it.  8-)  It just
doesn't seem to live up to its potential after you do that.   8-(
