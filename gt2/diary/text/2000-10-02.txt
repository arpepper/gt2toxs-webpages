My Impressions of Sports Car GT

Threads:
  Game Evaluation
  Other Games

Well, I stopped by a videogame store on my way home last Thursday
night, to pick up a $29.99Cdn DexDrive for my other set of nephews and
nieces.  At the same time I did some impulse buying.  I also picked up
a used V-Rally2 for $14.99 to give to the same nephews and nieces.
And, for myself, I managed to spot a $9.99 copy of Sports Car GT (for
the PlayStation).  Both games seemed to work okay, even though the CDs
looked a little smudged on the working surface.

I have now played with Sports Car GT a little, but not extensively.
The choice of real-life courses--Road Atlanta, Sebring, Laguna Seca and
Mosport is quite a good selection.  I found Road Atlanta seemed to have
slightly more intuitive "feel" than the others, but, in general, all of
them merely demonstrated how fantastic Gran Turismo Graphics are.  A
lot of the corners have a "two-dimensional" look to them, and the
Sports Car GT Laguna Seca Corkscew is nothing like the gut-wrenching
experience the Gran Turismo one is.  It's nice to have a reasonable
copy of the track in Mosport, Ontario, Canada, however.

The first time tried a quick "season", I somehow accidentally quit it
part-way through.  I went "back to the paddock" to try and do some
tuning and could not figure out how to go back to the race I was in,
and the game let me exit without an "Are you sure?".  Oh well, it let
me keep my prize money.  8-)

Later I managed to gain enough skill to finish in the top three for all
three races in the GTQ season so that I could advance to GT3.  The GT3
season features a rainy version of the Road Atlanta course, and it seemed
to me that that looked more realistic than did the dry weather version
of the same course.
