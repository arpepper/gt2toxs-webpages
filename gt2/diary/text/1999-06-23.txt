Today, in my "blue" fast game in which I was attempting to collect all
race prize cars in all colours, I entered the red Silvia LM (prize
from the All-Night I) in the Grand Valley 300.

I led from start to finish, even with pit stops.

I first lapped the sixth-place car on lap 12, and first lapped
the lead on lap 30.

I had one semi-major disaster while passing, and lapped the leaders
only once.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

My time was worse than I had previously done with this car, but I
had not practised in any other races at all.
