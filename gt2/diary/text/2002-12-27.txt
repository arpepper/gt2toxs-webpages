In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/24hour">24hour</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/24hour.txt">here</a>),
I decided to enter a tuned Mitsubishi GTO'92 twin turbo in
the All-Night II.

I started from pole position, got a good start, and never lost the lead.

I began lapping the cars on lap 9, but had to repass most of those
after my stop on lap 10.  I'm not sure when I lapped the field.

I had lots of minor mishaps; my tuning was not great and the car pulled to
the outside a bit under braking.
All-in-all this was a very mediocre run.
It's too bad I didn't use my own tuning advice from the last time I ran
this race with this car.

I won Cr150,000, and the silver Nismo GT-R LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
