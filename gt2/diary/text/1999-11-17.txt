Doing Weird Stuff with My Game Shark

  Game Shark Hints

Well, as I said, I bought a GameShark.  I have discovered a few neat things,
building on <html><a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com/">Code Master's Game Shark
Code Creators's Club</a>,
specifically <a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com/psx/grant11.shtml">Gran Turismo Version 1.1 Codes</a></html>.

There's something interesting, isn't it?  Apparently there were two
versions of Gran Turismo released in North America, distinguishable
only by their actual memory use.  I bought my first copy in December
1998, and it was already version 1.1, so I think the second version
must have come out fairly soon after the initial release, and I
think version 1.0 must actually be relatively rare.

If you're not from North America, I would say the place to look
for Xplorer type codes
is <html><a href="http://www.psxdomain.com/Cheats">www.psxdomain.com</a>,
specifically:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.psxdomain.com/Cheats/codes/pal/granturismo.html">the Pal Gran Turismo cheat codes</a>
<li><a href="http://www.psxdomain.com/Cheats/codes/jap/granturismo.html">the Japanese Gran Turismo cheat codes</a>
<li><a href="http://www.psxdomain.com/Cheats/codes/us/granturismo.html">the US Gran Turismo V1.0 cheat codes</a>
</ul> </html>

I'll probably add some details to this entry, or else in other entries.
