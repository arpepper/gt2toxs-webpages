Super Trucks Racing is a Good Deal Cheap

  Super Trucks Racing

<CODES>
A few weeks ago I picked up
<B>Super Trucks Racing</B> for my <B>PlayStation 2</B> from a
<B>Wal-Mart</B>, for less than <B>$20</B> (Canadian).
There is a web-site for the game at <html><a href="http://www.super-trucks.com/">
www.super-trucks.com</a></html>, but, in fact, it describes an older version of
the game--the newer version I have has more tracks and an extra series.

I'd first seen real-life <B>European Super Trucks</B> racing on television,
in the program <B>Motorsport Mundial</B> on <B>SPEED TV</B> (previously
<B>Speedvision</B>) (<html><a href="http://www.speedtv.com/">www.speedtv.com</a></html>).
The "tractor" parts of tractor-trailer combos,
painted in bright sponsor colour schemes, race with 1400hp engines on
tight tracks, creating quite a spectacle.

The game has no true career or simulation mode--the closest thing is
the "unlocking" of more advanced series by placing in the top three
in a lower series.  One really nice feature it has is a two-player
mode with AI racers also on the track.

It doesn't have quite the time-consuming depth of the <B><font color="blue">Gran</font>
<font color="red">Turismo</font></B>, but that's somewhat refreshing.  In
spite of that, it does have great range of difficulty between the easy
and later series, and the more advanced series do take a fairly long
time to play, although a series can be saved after each race.
Races feature qualifying--best of an up to five lap solo session (no
pesky AI trying to qualify at the same time), and your best lap in any
qualifying, practice session, or race will be recorded in a "hall of
records" if it beats the current records.  (Most tracks have preset
records which are relatively easy-to-beat, but one-or-two tracks are
difficult to set a first-place record on).

Graphics are similar to <B><font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font> 3</B>,
but not quite as realistic-looking.  Handling is similar to
<B><font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font> 3</B>, but
a little more arcadey.  You can save race replays, and they are well-done,
but you can't change the views at all.  Different trucks have different
characteristics, but there are no parts available.  There is a facility
for tuning handling, but it's rather difficult to use since it's a global
option for the whole game and all trucks, rather than being associated with
a particular truck.  You can't even tune during practice sessions, so that
makes it even more awkward.

Like <B><font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font></B>, and
unlike many games, your game controller setup is nearly arbitrarily
configurable, a feature I really like.

An interesting feature of driving these trucks is that you must control
the dispensing of water onto the brakes to cool them--and the water can
run out (although there seems to be more than enough for any race if
you're at all careful).

All-in-all I'd recommend this game if you happen to see it cheap, if for
nothing else than the "two player plus AI" mode.
