I took the tuned version of the 400R in my  <html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/nismo">nismo</a></html>
game to the All-Night II race as a warm-up for the Tuned Car Series.
It had already won the Mega-Speed Event, but that was a long time
ago.  8-)

This car did a reliable job of winning the All-nightII.

Another relatively easy race, although I had not lapped the field
by my first pit stop, although I was working on lapping them a
third time by the end of the race.  I did have a lot of chicane
accidents, however.

I won Cr150,000, and the silver Nismo GT-R LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...

Thread: Tuning Advice

These were how I found the settings, presumably after practise last
December winning the Mega-Speed Event.  (I had won the two Japanese
International Series in that game with a Nismo 400R with non-permanent
tuning only).

           My Settings

Tires:         S      S

Spring Rate    7.0    8.0
Ride Height     75    77   (min,min)
Dampers          4     4
Camber          2.0   1.0
Stabilizers      1     1
Brake Balance   12     9
Turbo               7
        1st       3.214
        2nd       1.925
        3rd       1.302
        4th       1.000
        5th       0.804
                  -----
        FD        3.700

Aero      (stock)

These settings, although they did not result in a great performance
here, were, except for turbo and gearing changes at the Autumn
Ring, were later sufficient to sweep the Tuned Car Series pretty
easily.
