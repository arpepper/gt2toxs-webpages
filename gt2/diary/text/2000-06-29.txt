I Add A Search Facility to this Diary

While doing some work for a professor, I learned of a freeware Search
Engine at <html><a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">
http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a></html>.

And so I used it to create this <html><a href="search.html">search</a></html>
facility for these diary pages.  So now you have an easy way to search
their entire content.  In addition, you can still search for words in
the <html><a href="fullindex.html">full index</a></html>, as you could
before.

Because of that and various other things, I have regenerated all pages
from their source.  (To suit the Search Engine, I added the title of
the page to the official title in the header; previously those titles
used to be the date only).

I've been wasting a lot of time recently driving the
Skyline R30 Silhouette Foumula[sic].  It is a ridiculously good car,
capable of winning all the premier events, and, since it has only
555 bhp, can enter a lot of secondary events (such as the GT300 in
which it annihilates the competition) as well.  This car is the
prize for winning the Tahiti Road Race of the 80's Series.  You can
win it in
either <html><font color="red">red</font> or <font color="blue">blue</font></html>.
