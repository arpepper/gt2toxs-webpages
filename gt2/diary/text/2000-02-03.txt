Fun with a GameShark Pro and GT v2.0

Threads:
  Game Shark Hints

I've been too busy to create diary entries recently.  I'll probably
fill in a few prior to this one, probably by reworking some of my
usenet postings.

I finally got around to playing with a GameShark and Gran Turismo
2.  I was curious to try out the secret Mercedes-Benz CLK Race
Car.  I was still using the buggy North American version 2.0 
Gran Turismo, since I haven't got around to getting the new
version yet.

(E.g. always inspect the value of a location for consistency before
changing it).

Afterwards I searched for the day counter.  Since I was at day 372,
and had got hints from the Web about the location of the garage
information and such, I found it quite quickly.

         simulation day counter - By changing this, you can change the
	 used car inventory.  However, you must set it, exit to the
	 main menu, and then select "Start Game" again, to actually
	 generate the new inventory.

By using this, I examined the stock for day 600, 610, day 10,
and checked day 1 by starting a new game.  I was able to confirm
that the used car cycle probably repeats on day 600, just like
in GT1.

         This, I learned from the newsgroups, is the start of a table
         for the Honda used car stock.  Each car has an 8-byte table
         entry describing its make, model, price, and colour.  You
         can patch in arbitrary values using the memory editor, and
         then by them.   This is how you can buy the hidden Mercedes-Benz
         [R]CLK Race Car.  Here are some values you can put there.

For example, I completely crashed my game and trashed my garage
when I first put in the Mercedes CLK code with the bytes swapped.
(I did not overwrite any game save, of course--I always remove
memory cards when they are not needed while sharking).
