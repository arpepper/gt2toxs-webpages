  Real Life

On Sunday June 10, 2001 I finally met in person some of the fellow
Gran Turismo afficionados whom I had previously known only via the
Internet.

Present at the party in Burlington were friends from <html><a href="http://www.granturismo.com/">www.granturismo.com</a>:
<b>Fogelhund</b> (the host), <b>malkie</b>, <b>dubmode</b>,
<b>SlipZtrEm</b>, as well as <b>George</b>, a friend of <b>Fogelhund</b>'s,
and of course, myself (<b>GT2toXS</b>, aka <b>SportWagon</b>)</html>.

The event was a lot of fun even though, for various reasons, I did not
win a single race.  8-(

Here are pictures:

With one exception (the one with three people in it) I named all the
subjects from your left to right.  That's why you have <b>SportWagon</b>
and <b>malkie</b> when seen from behind, but <b>malkie</b> and
<b>SportWagon</b> when you see them from the front, okay?

Somehow I lost the more sombre of the two prize-presentation pictures.  8-)

Note there is a lighting problem for the original presentation
shot (faces too dark to distinguish on some screens).  My version
used <b>ImageMagick gamma</b> transform, whatever that is; it seemed to
lighten it for me, and fix the problem when I viewed my LCD from an angle,
but I may have overdone it a bit.

Those are pretty much all the pictures we took.

	
<b>Fogelhund</b> said of the event:

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>I want to thank everybody who attended the first GTF GT Party in
Ontario.... Thanks.  I had a great time, and it was nice meeting you
guys in person.  Mrs. Fogelhund seemed pleased the way the event went,
which means it is not out of the question that we can possibly host
another one in the future.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Everybody got to meet the real Fogelhund, Foster, [a German Retriever]
and of course we had a
bit of friendly competition going.  There was some great racing, Dubmode
really had his Lotus Europa set up well, but in one of the races, he
had it a bit off and given it was the green Lotus, we had to rename it
the John Deere Special  8-) .</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Malkie discovered that the Camaro Z28 is indeed not a bad ride, and will
be giving me fits now in the Historic Sportscar Series.  Thanks for
bringing the Pop and Chips as well.  Mrs. Fogelhund swore at me when
she saw the case of Coke..damn it took 4 months to get rid of the first
case we had..now we have another..I explained it just meant we would have
to have another GTP soon.  8-) Nice drive in the Alfa DTM at Tahiti.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>SportWagon</b>, aka <b>GT2XS</b>, was kind enough to bring quite a
bit of equipment, including a computer to show us Grand Prix legends,
and a bit of a display of his cracker jack gameshark programming.  And of
course many thanks to him for donating the prize car for the driver who
would win the mini-tournament that was held, the 1996 LeMans Oreca Viper,
from when the car was still running in the GT1 class.  Also thanks for
setting up my Mercedes DTM for our race at Tahiti, it handles great.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>SlipZtrEm</b> had a well prepared 71' Nissan Skyline in the
Historic Race, and taught me a lesson I won't soon forget. 8-)
No mercy, ever.  It was great having you out, and we will have to do a
bit more racing against each other some time, as we do live insanely
close to each other.  He also showed some master driving, moving the
Big Speed 12 around Red Rock in a speedy way.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>My friend George was there as well, but don't mistake him for the "George"
on the GTF board; they are two separate people.  George managed to keep
up with the GTF experts pretty well, especially given he had only really
raced at Tahiti Road, and High Speed Ring before.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Thanks again guys, and it was nice having some great competition in 2
player racing.</td></tr></table>
	
	
<b>SlipZtrEm</b> replied:

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Hey now, you forgot my lovely finish through the pit at Tahiti 8-)</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>It was really great fun, I must thank everyone for coming, in a similar
way to <b>Fogey</b></td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>SportWagon</b> - We both had a heck of a time at Red Rock with our
almost-identical Speed 12s  8-)</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>Malkie</b> - For bringing along Colin McRae, and the bump and grind
racing we had at Tahiti (too bad the Calibra was such a handful).</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>Dubmode</b> - If I remember, you were the one I ended up in the pit against
8-) .  Close racing, and always nice to meet an old teammate.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td><b>Fogelhund</b> - You taught me how to properly drive freaky! I
never did it quite like that, and I'm quite sure without a hands-on
experience, I would never be able to. Oh, and I really didn't set up the
Skyline anyways, you did.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>And while George isn't here, I'd like to thank him for the close racing
we had, and for giving me the ride home.</td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Definitely fun, and I'm surely up to another, maybe with GT3.</td></tr></table>
	
<b>Fogelhund</b> then added:

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>Damn, how could I forget that...a first I think, slides his car too far
to the left coming out of the last corner at Tahiti, and into the pits.
It was hilarious, last lap, and with a bit of a lead, going down the pits
at max pit speed, with Dub closing in quickly..Slip just barely wins...we
should have saved that race.  8-)</td></tr></table>
