I Manage to Find a Scale-Model Subaru Impreza

Threads:
  Car Information
  Real Life

Well, over a year ago I bought, in real life, a Subaru Impreza Sport
Wagon.  (It's not a WRX model, though, and does not have a turbo).
After that, I noticed that you cannot, in general, find any diecast
scale-model Subaru, neither toys nor collectibles.

There are a few however.  A couple of weeks ago at my local car collectible
store I did see a rally-model Subaru Impreza.  It was rather expensive, and
in strange colours, so I did not buy it right away.  A few days ago I went
back and bought it, and, since then, the colour-scheme has sort of grown
on me.

You can find a lot of pictures and some information about the real-life
prototype here: http://www.armin-kremer.de/

Here's a nice picture from there:

The car is painted in the colours used by the three-time German
national rally champion, Armin Kremer, numbered for the 1999 German
Rally.

The model is produced in China by the German company <b>AutoArt</b>.

Here's a picture of the model from that site:

The model is relatively large, being 1:18 scale and therefore about
nine inches (23cm) long.  The display case box is over-sized, making
the entire item quite a large thing to store.

The level of detail and realism is incredible, with my only complaint
being that the suspension does not move, and the front wheels, while
they do steer, foul on the wheel wells after only a slight movement.
