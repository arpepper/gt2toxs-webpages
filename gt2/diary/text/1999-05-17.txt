First off, I could have come second, but let the GT-R ahead on the last
lap in order to confirm what 3rd place prize money was.  No really!!!

I was in a solid second place until my first pit stop.  Then I
dropped to 4th, got to 1st in the exchange, but was raced into
2nd.

lap 20 - dropped to 3rd.

lap 30 - dropped from  1st to 3rd again.

On the road, I just barely got 1st by lap 40, but my pit stop put
me in third.  8-(

My stop at lap 50 put me in a solid 2nd.  8-(  No last-minute stop
by the leader to put me in the lead this time...

In fact, the third place car did begin challenging me, but I could
have held him off.  In fact, it was quite difficult letting him
by for the last time.  (Note my very slow last lap time).

I had several problems negotiating "the hairpin".

I won Cr150,000, and no car.

The next Grand Valley 300 entrant will be an encore performance by
the ConceptCar.  And, after that, I think I will take a rest.
