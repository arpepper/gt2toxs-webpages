In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/mazda">mazda</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/mazda.txt">here</a>),
I used the 1991 FD RX-7 efini Type R for many races.
So I decided to enter the race-modified version in
the All-Night I.

I went straight into the lead, and never lost it, winning a rather
dull, uninteresting race.

I did spin a complete loop in the lighted tunnel on lap 26.

On my final lap I was coming up to lap the the GT-R LM one last time,
but didn't quite manage to pass it.

I won Cr150,000, and a green Silvia LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
