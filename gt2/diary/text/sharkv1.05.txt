This version shows IA only above the Muscle Car Cup on the page
under Special Events.

This version spells "Normal" correctly for the Event Generator.

But...
This version still shows a Cr5,000 car wash.
This version still has the garage delete bug (at least when I began
by using a load of an old game, since I didn't want to build up to
eight or nine cars.  I might try that sometime...)

801C97A8 - A. day counter (as you see in bottom-left corner),4b,391
801C97B0 - B. total races,4b,435
801C97B4 - C. total wins,4b,371
801C97B8 - D. total "positions" or "rankings",4b,541
801C97BA - E. total races not including abandons(?),4b,433
     D/E does appear to equal "average ranking"
801C97C8 - total prize money,4b,15,985,000

Following this appears to be various "nybble maps" probably
representing license status, plus various records, probably
license and maybe Time Trials, ending with the dreaded
Machine Test records, including the most deadly Max Speed
records.

801CD280 - # of max speed records
801CD284 - 8 max speed records, 20 bytes each
              car(4b),speed*100(4b),name(12b)
         - problem is, sometimes the game thinks there's room for 10  :)

801CD324 - garage count (number of cars)
801CD328 - first car of 100 car garage

Soon after the end of the garage is...

801D1338 - number of credits in your bank account
801D133C - zero-origin index of current car in garage
801D133E - last name used for records, e.g.  ARP17Jan00

Most, if not all, of these locations are hex 370 greater than the
version 1.0 locations, I believe.

Coming later...  "Current Race" information...
Scanning that area of memory with a Game Shark Pro allows you to
see a "Starting Line-Up" for your race, amongst other things.

Oh yeah, I should try and find the used car lots, too...
