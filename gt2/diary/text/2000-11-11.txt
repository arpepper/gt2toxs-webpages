In the <html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/lancer">lancer</a></html> game I
used the Lancer Evolution IV GSR (4WD Series prize) as much as possible, so I entered the
race-modified version in the All-Night I Endurance race at Special Stage R11.

Oops.  I accidentally used automatic transmission during qualifying.
Oh well, I managed to com first anyway.

I got the lead by the first corner, and a couple of good laps immediately
after that gave me a solid lead, out of the traffic which can slow you
down so much at this course.

I lapped the Lantis before my first pit stop.

I eventually lapped the field (the GTO) on lap 19.

I almost lapped the Supra a second time, but didn't quite manage it, and
had some bad laps times in the process.  In general, I had quite a few
mishaps in this race when I encountered traffic.

I won Cr150,000, and a red Silvia LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
