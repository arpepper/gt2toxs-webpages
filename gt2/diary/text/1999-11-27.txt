After well over a thousand tries, I finally win the gold medal for B-3

  License Test Progress

Well, a little (a lot actually) persistence paid off again.  I did a
gold medel time for B-3!  (The del Sol at Deep Forest).

I got 28.143 seconds, just .007 under the required 28.150; my
best failing time was 28.152, and that stayed around for a long
time.  I got 28.167 several times, too.

So I went on to B-5 (the GTO twinturbo at the same course), and found
it harder than I had remembered.
