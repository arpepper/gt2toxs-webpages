A Couple of Tricky Tips for GT2

Threads:
  Gran Turismo 2
  Gameplay Hints

Reading rec.games.sony.video I saw someone mention a couple of
undocumented features in Gran Turismo 2 that are potentially
useful.

First of all, if you are in your garage, and press "start", the
highlighted car (ie. not necessary the one you are currently
driving) moves to the top slot of your garage.

Secondly, if you use the R buttons during replays, it will skip
or rerun laps.

I tested the garage ordering feature, but have not tried the
replay feature yet.
