I Actually Finally Get Gold on GT3 B-8

Well, I finally managed gold on <font color="blue"><b>G</b></font><font color="red"><b>T</b></font><b>3</b> <b>B-8</b>.

I got <b>0:42.854</b> to the demo <b>0:42.949</b>.

I had seemed to be doing well--silver about every three or four runs, and only infrequent crash failures.

Here's my summary of the technique I tried to apply:
</CODES>
<HTML INDENT>
<ul>
<li> easy through first left through tunnel, but no lifting or braking necessary--just try to reduce tire squealing, keeping speed close to 69mph
<li> slow, and brake, but not too much for the first right
<li> enter the second right a little wide, and cut in
  (this is the trickiest corner of the test)
<li> if you're on track for gold, you must lift off the accelerator before the second tunnel
<li> want to exit tunnel lodged in groove, over hash marks, accelerating early, but somewhat gradually
</ul>
</HTML>

<CODES>
In my successful run, I hit the split-time at <b>0:28.635</b>, well below demo of <b>0:28.771</b>.

"Stay in groove, ease on gas early--don't blow it", I thought.

I got in the groove, but felt a slight burble on my exit.

"Oh well", I thought, "That probably blew it, but your speed is okay--keep it nailed, and away from the edge of the road, and it looks like the upshift will come well before the exit of the tunnel."

I saw the "42" on the stopped clock, and then the "Gold medal" appeared, much to my relief.  I was amazed that I had made it by so large a margin.

"Remember to save replay".

Then I checked the demo once before exiting (although, in fact, you can come back later to do that).  It showed I got an early lead by cutting over the apron in the first tunnel.  I lost a little in the first right-hander, but perhaps gained it back in the next.  The split time shows I lost a little in the last corner, and finished just barely ahead of the demo (under 1/10 sec).

Then I saved my game, and went downstairs to get another memory card to make a second copy.  8-)

My recorded times
(I did not save sessions which did not improve my best time...)

ARP2004Jan25 0:42.854 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan11 0:43.014 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan25 0:43.044 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan03 0:43.058 25/01/04
ARP2003Dec21 0:43.156 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan25 0:43.175 25/01/04

(Actually my name is saved as ARP2003Jan25, etc...  Duh!)

Final speed: 118mph, just barely.
I had had better finishes (118 clearly for about a second).
