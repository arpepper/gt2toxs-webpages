Amazing Game Shark Discovery for Gran Turismo 2, version 1.0

Here is a brief memory map of some locations I found by inspecting the
simulation mode disk from my original "1.0" copy of Gran Turismo 2.


This version shows three licenses above the Muscle Car Cup on the page
under Special Events.

This version spells "Nomal" incorrectly for the Event Generator.

This version shows a Cr5,000 car wash.<html><br></html>
This version has the garage delete bug.

801C9438 - A. day counter (as you see in bottom-left corner),4b,$ED,237
801C9440 - B. total races,4b,$F6,246
801C9444 - C. total wins,4b,$F6,246
801C9448 - D. total "positions" or "rankings",4b,$F6,246
801C944A - E. total races not including abandons(?),4b,$F6,246
     D/E does appear to equal "average ranking"

(sample values in this case are not conclusive   8-) )

801C9458 - nybble map for game completion
     each nybble represents a placing in an event (0 means event
     not entered, or position does not correspond to an event).
     The number of 1's is dynamically added up and divided by
     the expected total to give the % complete.  You can actually
     change a nybble in the memory editor while the game is in
     the status screen, and, when you exit, that change will be
     immediately shown in the percentage displayed.

In version 1.0 you can easily go up to 111.21% complete.   8-)
