I Finally Manage To Get a GT1 Version 1.0 Disk!

Every time I entered a store with used PlayStation games I tended to
hover around looking at the copies of 
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
wondering if I could spot something to tell me that the corresponding disk
was likely to be version 1.0, as opposed to the version 1.1 I have several
copies of.

Well, about a week ago I had done exactly that at an <b>EB Games</b> (a
variation of <b>Electronics Boutique</b>) in the mall where we like to
go grocery shopping.  They actually had six cases in total--three with
<b>Greatest Hits</b> labels, and three more without--only $9.99 each.
Now, the <b>Greatest Hits</b> versions never will be version 1.0, but
older versions might.

So today I went back and actually decided to buy one of the games.
I got to the store about ten minutes before closing.  I brought the
case to the front, and said I'd definitely buy the game if the CD had
a coloured top, trying to explain that I wanted an old version for
<b>Game Shark</b> purposes.  But the clerk thought, and I subsequently
came to agree, that <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
never came with coloured-top disks--only silver.

So there were two possible sets of disks for the 
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
case I had.  (Since, a week later, there were still two <b>Greatest
Hits</b> and two plain cases, it seems that <b>EB</b> must distinguish
between <b>Greatest Hits</b> and plain versions in their inventory).
Neither had coloured graphics on the top.  But I agreed to buy one anyway.
The clerk went to give me the better copy, but I said, "No, give me the
scratched copy.  It's likely to be older, and I'm looking for an old
version".  She agreed to sell me that disk.

When I got home and looked at the disk I agreed that it did not look like
a preferable copy to sell,  It looked almost like someone had scratched
it with a knife--I don't know how someone lets their disks get like that.
It was all the more surprising since the manuals were impeccable.

So I loaded the disk into my <b>GS Pro</b>-equipped <b>PlayStation One</b>,
and started the game, thinking "Oh well, I hope this works".
And somewhat to my surprise, it did.

I grabbed my <b>PDA</b> and found the <a href="../diary/2000-11-01.html">Nov 1, 2000 page</a>
in this diary where I noted 
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
garage structure.  I then went into simulation mode, and
then into the <b>Game Shark Memory Editor</b> and found the indicated
location for money.  And it was zeroes!!!

Scanning upward I found the hex <b>10 27</b> pattern (i.e. <b>2710</b>
which represents your initial <b>Cr10,000</b>).  Checking with a
hard-copy of <b>Game Shark version 1.0</b> codes confirmed that, indeed
I was now looking at version 1.0.

Later I discovered that the disk will not work in <b>Arcade Mode</b>.
The mini-replays in the track selection screen do not get loaded, and
the game locks up when try to select your track.  Oh well.

Sometimes certain options in simulation mode seem to take an enormously
long time to complete in simulation mode, too--as if the game is
retrying some loads many many times before they succeed.

I found no difference on the top side of the disk, and no difference in
the printing on the case or manuals to distinguish this disk from the
others I already had.  But I did find one minor difference which I may be
able to use to determine that a particular copy is likely to be version
1.0.  All other <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1"
color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> copies I had came in a
custom double CD sized case which had a mounting point for only one CD.
This game had mounting points for not only the two you might expect,
but three!  (It not only had the usual CD mount on the outside bottom
panel of the case, but also ones on both sides of the inside divider--in fact,
this made it rather difficult to fit the sizable manuals inside the case).
There were no obvious signs that this case had been substituted for
the original, but that is, I suppose, a possibility.

I tried crude techniques to repair the CD, but they didn't help much,
if at all.  So I now have a copy of version 1.0 which I can use to verify
some translations of some of my codes, but I will remain on the lookout
for a better copy.
