RX7 LM Edition can give the Cerbera LM a run for its money

Well, the RX7 LM Edition is both pleasant to drive, and reasonably
fast.  It didn't seem ideal at the Grand Valley 300, taking slightly
longer than the Cerbera LM did, with 12 lap pitstops being a bit of
a stretch.

I had two spinouts, and a couple of near ones.  (wheels in gravel)
As you can tell, I lapped the entire field twice, and the Lantis
five times.  (Lantis average lap time was 1:48 or so, i.e. 108
seconds; 5*108 = 540 seconds, so it still had five laps to do
when I was done).

Of course, I won Cr300,000 plus a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

Note the strength and competitiveness of the field.  Previously there
have always been two or three "turtles" or near-turtles.  The
finishing time was actually over twenty seconds slower than the
Cerbera LM had managed.  (1-38.03.8)

As an additional note, after observations during practice I began
running this car with 5F/4R stabilizer settings.  It seems to
help prevent tail-slides.

Encouraged by this, I felt the RX7 should be able to set some
more records in the UKvsJP.  Here's the results, in a session
with minimal practice runs.

This won the series, 45 to 30, and won a green Cerbera  8-(.

The next Grand Valley 300 contender will be the Mitsubishi special
model, the GTO LM.  This is a tubby, heavy, 4wd model with lots
of torque.  In Time Trial practice at Grand Valley, it had trouble
beating the Mitsubishi Eclipse ghost.  But it seems more promising
than the NSX-R LM GT2.  It recovers nicely after bumps, etc.  So
this seems to be a car which might come between second and fifth
in the GV300, to help me fill in the prize money grid.

The GTO LM swept the UKvsJP, setting no records, winning 45 to 28, and
winning a green Cerbera LM.
