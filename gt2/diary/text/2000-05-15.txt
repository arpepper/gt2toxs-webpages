(GT2 Version 1.0)  GameShark Code to Set Up Silly Fake Drag Racing

Here is a code, for North American Gran Turismo 2, version 1.0
(Simulation Mode)

What it does is arrange that whenever you attempt to enter any race in
Simulation Mode at any Seattle course (or any other course beginning
"Se"--I don't think there are any), the race gets hijacked to the
Max Speed Test course for a 1000m "drag race".

The Max Speed Test track has the property that the start line is
1000m away from the finish line.  So, if you start on lap 1 of a
lap 1 race, you will be done as soon as you cross the finish line,
but that finish line is actually a full 1000m away.

Unfortunately, the cars are not lined up evenly for the start.  I
have put you on grid spot 3, and the AI car in grid spot 2.  If
I put the AI car in grid spot 1, it will move across in front of
or behind you, and spoil the drag race effect, and so therefore
I used spots 2 and 3 since usually the AI can benefit from a
slight head start.  8-)

Notes:
C01D52DC 6553 -- Do no codes unless track name starts "Se"
The first "global condition" can be set to anything you think is
appropriate.  Another reasonable thing might be to do this drag
race thing if the track name is "Te".  The way I have it here, however,
"Se" causes Seattle races, which often include Muscle Cars in the
Field, to be hijacked to the Max Speed Test track for a 1000m
"drag race".  Only one C0 code should be active at once in all
codes you have "active"; apparently the last one processed by
the Game Shark will be the one actually in effect.  That is, use
this code by itself, without any other codes active, or it will
interfere with those other codes.

While you should be able to play most of the game with these codes on,
I wouldn't guarantee it, and it makes most sense to me to activate the
codes, play some drag races, and never save the game with the codes in
effect.  Don't bother saving any replays; they're liable to screw up,
unless you view them with this code in effect.

If someone wants to take this principle, and go ahead and work out
two-player drag racing of the same sort (arguably more interesting)
go right ahead.  I'd have to be particularly bored to do that, since
it will need the Arcade disk which I rarely use, and I rarely have
anyone else to play <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="black">2</font></html> against.

If your GameShark does not support C0, but does support D0, you can put

D01D52DC 6553

(Ie. Do next code only if track name starts "Se")

in front of every other code, *except* the four lines at the bottom,
and then hope for the best.

I.e.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801D52FC 23D2 -- set track to Max Speed Test
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801D52FE 74C8 -- set track, part two
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 301D53A5 0002 -- you start as #3 on grid
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 301D5475 0001 -- AI starts as #2 on grid
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801FFE7A 0001 -- make race only 1 lap long
 D01D52DC 6553 -- Do next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801FFE7C 0002 -- have only 2 cars in field (you + 1 AI)
 D00A99AC 0000 -- when your lap count is zero
 800A99AC 0001 -- ... set your lap count to one
 D00AA4EC 0000 -- when 1st AI lap count is zero
 800AA4EC 0001 -- ... set 1st AI lap count to one (ie start on lap 1)

All the usual cautions with GameShark Codes apply in this case.
