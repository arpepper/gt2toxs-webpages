[R]Viper GTS far outperforms Viper GTS-R at Grand Valley 300

I had expected the race-modded red Viper GTS to be much easier to
drive and much faster than its supposedly superior cousin, the
GTS-R, and I was not disappointed.

Consistency was the key here.  Compare the times to the Supra RZ,
for instance.  The Supra had some faster lap times, but less
consistency, and so was slightly slower overall.

I got off to a rasonable start for once, getting the lead by the
end of the first lap.  I lapped the last-place car just before my
first pit stop, and never lost the lead at all.

The average lap time (as evidenced by reading the finishing time)
was a lot closer to the fastest lap time for this car than for any
other.  As far as I can remember, I had no disasters at all!

I did not do many 1:35 laps, but a lot of 1:36's.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

After the race, I tried a time trial, and managed 3:15.616
for two laps.  My first lap was almost identical to my qualifying
time.

I then took the ConceptCar out, and (eventually; it is very difficult
to get used to) did 1:34.427 + 1:28.998 = 3:03.425; once or twice
I had done a 1:33.xxx first lap, too.

I then took the race-modded GTO'95 MR out, since it is the next
candidate for the Grand Valley 300.  I tried hard, and eventually
beat its existing 3:16.xxx ghost record.  Then I switched to the
normal intercooler, and going fast was much easier and I soon did
3:13.939; later I was to discover that the top gear needed reducing
in order to allow acceleration.

Anyway, for a quick warm-up, I tried the 4wd Challenge, which I
hadn't done in a while.  Here are the results.

According to all FAQs, I have all my cars for that event, so, of
course, the yellow Lancer EvolIV GSR I won was a duplicate.
