In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/24hour">24hour</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/24hour.txt">here</a>),
I used the FCRX7 for many races.
So I decided to enter the race-modified version in
the All-Night I.

Although I started in first place, I struggled for the first two laps,
finally getting a slim lead on the second-place Skyline.

Two bad accidents on lap 9 and 11 greatly reduced my lead, meaning that
when I went for my pit stop on lap 15 I actually dropped back to 3rd place.
I managed to regain the lead on the road, however, and after that both
cars pitted another time.

I had no more outrageous accidents, and eventually won by a healthy
margin, lapped the EXIV 200GT right near the end of the race, leaving
only two cars finishing on the same lap.

In contrast to many endurance races in Gran Turismo, this one was almost
exciting.  For example, I lapped my first car (the Lantis) while I was
still only in second place.

I won Cr150,000, and a green Silvia LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
