Utilizing Procedures for Getting International Prize Cars

Threads:
  Prize Car Patterns

I started playing the "alternate" game which previously won me the
yellow ConceptCar.  Here's what happened.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Day(s)           Car         Event                Prize Car

    376      [R]GTO'95MR       USvsJP sweep45to30    green FTO LM!!!!!!
    382

So that quite quickly got the complete set of USvsJP prize cars.

The only surprise was getting a black FTO LM with the purple ConceptCar
which previously only seemed to win white Vipers with blue stripes.
In theory I should have persisted with the purple ConceptCar, but
since I expected it to bring repeats, that is very difficult to do.
I have kept a save of day 351 on a MegaMemory card, so I might
go back and try several times with that car, as well as trying
the GTO'95MR without first winning GT-I with it.

It could be, you know, that "GTO'95MR" is all the magic you need to
get all the prize cars from the USvsJP series.
