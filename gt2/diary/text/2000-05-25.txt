Tired of Typing in Car Codes to Get Prize Cars?

These GameShark Codes to let you see and buy all colours of all prize
cars

This code combines my discovery of the race prize-list with my
old "view cars in Toyota New Car Lineup Page 1" code, (which I
must also post here sometime).

This code needs a <b>GS</b> which supports the <b>C2</b> "memory
copy" code.  That is, as far as I can tell, a <b>GS</b> 3.00 or greater.
I also rely on the <b>10</b> "add" code with a value of zero working as a
no-operation.  (i.e. not changing anything).

With these twelve lines you can get access to all the prize cars for
purchase.  With the code active, simply enter any event (including
license tests).  After that, if you go to the first page of the Toyota
New Car Lineup, the first four cars should be the four prize cars
from that event.  You can view the different colours, and purchase
them (if you have enough money).

If fewer than four prize cars are awarded for the event, then prize
cars from earlier events will remain available.  Conversely, if you go
to the Toyota New Car Lineup Page 1 before having entered an event
which awards four prize cars, some or all of the changed cars will show
a price of Cr0.  Do not view those cars.  :)  Doing so will not do
anything useful, and will probably require resetting the game.

Enjoy!
