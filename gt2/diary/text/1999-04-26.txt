Working my way through my garage I could not avoid the Toyota Chaser
LM Edition.  On the other hand, perhaps I should have tried harder
to avoid it.

Well, in warm-up it did win the UKvsJP, 40to26, winning a black del
Sol, coming 3rd at Trial Mountain ii.

Oh dear, oh dear.  Just as much of a piece of junk as everyone says,
and, with my lack of talent, I can't even get it to win.

Thread: Prize Money

I sat in fourth place most of the race, taking third only briefly
during a pit-stop exchange.  I lost about 10 seconds on lap 23 trying
to fight with the Impreza instead of just letting it by since I had
worse tires.

I won Cr100,000.

To continue my personal endurance theme, I decided to race another
GV300 that day, and proceeding through my garage I came across the
race-modified '89 Skyline GT-R.

I toyed with entering the tuned version of the same car, but it did
not do well enough in UKvsJP, winning only 42 to 26 after coming
second at Trial Mountain ii.  It did, however, qualify first in the
last three races as well as finishing first in the last four.  It
won, of course, a green Cerbera.

The Racing '89 Skyline GT-R did much better:

                won 45 to 30,    getting a green Cerbera

So I decided to skip entering the tuned Skyline in the GV300, for now,
at least, and go with the race modified one.

                      (25out) 1:41.817

I jostled at the start, and a minor disaster a few laps in kept the
second place car closer than it otherwise would be.  I dropped to
second after my first pit-stop, regaining the lead after the exchange
was completed and then holding it from then on.

I won Cr300,000 plus a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

While not exactly stellar, this car gets the job done.  I ran with
normal intercooler and turbo spec 4, giving me 800+ bhp.

The next car that comes up in my garage is, unfortunately, the Mazda
RX-7 Aspec LM Edition prize car.  This car gets terrible reviews
everywhere, and, indeed, seemed only slightly better than the Chaser
LM in warm-up at JPvsUS.  It came 2nd at Trial Mountain ii, but
swept the rest of the series, winning 42 to 27, and getting a
green FTO LM Edition.

I think I'll take a rest from enduros as I get used to this car so
as to give it a fair chance in the GV300.
