I Have Finally Collected ALL 62 Race-Series Prize Cars!!!

  Tuned Series Results

Last night I raced my RT/10 in the Tuned Series again, and won it.  I
came 2nd at Grand Valley, but actually won quite cleanly at Autumn
Ring.

But then I got a bit of a shock at SSR11.

I decided to do no practice laps, and just barely qualified in pole
position.

I fell to second at that first chicane, as I approached it a little
*too* cautiously, and an AI car snuck by me.

I regained first soon, in the fast wall at the end of the near-straight
after the tunnel hairpin, but that might have been a mistake.

As I approached the barrier chicane a little too cautiously, the
second-place car knocked me out of control, and I dropped to fifth
place.  I got back to third quickly, and second soon enough (in the
quick right-left that goes past the buildings, I believe), but
trailed in second place for over a lap.  Strangely, I regained the
lead in that first chicane!  I then managed a reasonably fast lap
(1:48.212; a record for this car, I believe), and held the lead to the
end.  According to my records, I won with my worst winning time ever
for that race; 9:23.806

In fact, I would have won the series even if I came sixth in the last
race.

But for my efforts I did get the yellow Skyline, the last remaining
Prize car in this, or any, race series I have to win.  8-)

So now I have a complete set of race prize cars.  8-)

In short, I guess I have a high boredom tolerance...   8-)

Don't have the co-ordination to go for gold license tests, though.
