Castrol Supra GT Improves Time only Slightly at the Grand Valley 300

Well, although it seemed to live up to its reputation the first time
I tried it, the Toyota Castrol Supra GT did not improve itst
time anything like as much as the other cars did.

Prior to running the Grand Valley 300, but not immediately before
it, I used this car to win the GT-I Cup 46 to 36, coming 2nd
at Trial Mountain to the GTO twinturbo, and 3rd at Deep Forest.

Note that my game is once again at an even multiple of 600 days,
and, sure enough, the used car stock is the same as on day 1.

I got the lead by the end of the first lap, and, even with my early
pit-stop strategy, never lost it.  I used lots of pit stops to see
if that could make up for relatively heavy tire wear, coupled with
handling unusually sensitive to that wear.

The field was relatively strong, and I didn't lap the last-place
car until lap 12.  I lapped the field at lap 29, and it stuck.

Several times I had chosen between an 8 or 9 lap shift to avoid
traffic.

At lap 51, I was coming up on very heavy traffic, so chose the
early option, instead of waiting until lap 52.  So then I finally
lapped the entire field twice by about lap 54.

The first three AI cars (including another Castrol Supra--whee!)
were in a close race throughout the whole race.

I had no major disasters, but a few minor ones.

Most laps were 1:34's and 1:35's, only one 1:32.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

This car is powerful, and relatively predicatable, but has a tendency
to lose control slightly, resulting in lost speed.

I was disappointed with my result; unlike the three minute or so
improvement other cars realized, this one only improved its old time by
about 1:20 (and that had been with only 4 pit stops).
