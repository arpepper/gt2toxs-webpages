In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/proper">proper</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/proper.txt">here</a>)
I decided to use the race-modified Subaru Impreza WRX-STi Version III
(Normal Prize) in the
Grand Valley 300.

It was, as might be expected, a very easy win.

I basically zipped into the lead, although I had to jostle with the
Skyline a little bit on the first lap.

I lapped the Lantis on lap 8.

The race was mostly uneventful, although I did lose control at the first
hairpin once, after trying to pass the NSX on the outside going into it.
That was probably lap 43.

The biggest excitement came when I had to alter my pit-stop strategy after
accidentally pitting on lap 30.  Based on my pre-race testing, I decided
I could stretch the shifts out and make only one more pit-stop.

At the finish I was just about to lap the Skyline yet another time.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

My time was my fastest Impreza time to date, beating the Rally Edition
and the 1994 Wagon.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 60 lap times...

Note that my second half time was faster than my first, although I think
I would have been a little bit faster if I had stuck to my original
pit strategy of four evenly-spaced stops.

Actual total count, at 800BDB74, was 00579BA3, or 5741475 thousandths
of seconds.  So the above is exactly right.

printf("%d\n", 0x579BA3);
