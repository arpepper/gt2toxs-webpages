Oh no.  I finally went and bought a GameShark

Threads:
  Gameplay Hints
  Hardware Hints

I finally bought a GameShark yesterday.  Even without many explicit
hints, but given the way I remembered things working, I quickly
figured out how to patch myself lots of credits.  (Not that I need
that).   And I found some sites that tell me more useful information,
most noticeably the location of the garage.

I was moderately pleased with the GameShark as a product.  When
advertized it never emphasizes some of the monitor aspects it
actually does have, and a recommendation that an Xplorer was a
better product had me worried about whether I would be able to
do the exploration I wanted with a GameShark.  I never managed to
find a magazine ad for an Xplorer, so I have bought the readily
available GameShark instead.

The GameShark does have memory search capabilities, although only for
16 bit quantities or "strings" string is restricted to case-insensitive
letters and digits.  It cannot search for 32 bit quantities nor arbitrary
patterns of bytes.   (Actually, I think if you search for a number less
than 256 it may do a byte search, which may not be what you want).

I did spot the string "Day %4d" in memory which suggests two things.
   
   1) Gran Turismo may be written in C/C++.
   2) If you get to day 10000, the display may get messed up.

Oh well.  I've got to take the web documents I found home so I can
begin creating nifty cars that I don't deserve to have.  I might
some day play a game (I now more-or-less define a simulation game
as obtaining all 17 gold race cups) where the only non-prize car
I use is the Nismo 400R.  8-)  I don't think I'll ever get too
deeply into hybrids.


A few days ago I realized something else.  You can apply racing
modification after weight reduction.  I had not realized that.  I had
always assumed they were mutually exclusive, but, in fact, although in
some sense it's a "waste of money", you can max-tune a car and add
racing modification afterwards.

A new game I've started now is 
The most recent game I have completed is the <a href="logs/platinum">platinum</a>
game.  This started from day 39 of the <a href="logs/gold">gold</a>
game, as I go with prize cars instead of using GTO'95MR.

Lucky for me I've won a Skyline in that game, so it can clean up things
(principally the Mega) that the Impreza cannot.  I might still try the
Impreza in the All-night ii, however; my backup plan was to win the
All-night ii with the Impreza and use the Nismo GT-R LM in the Mega.
Perhaps I will use the Chaser LM in the All-night i.  Ick.  But I
find it difficult to imagine I can win that with the Impreza, and
that's what you need to win to get one of the best LM cars in the
game, and have a comfortable way of winning the Grand Valley 300
and another good LM prize car.  Too bad Cerbera LMs don't seem to
show up in these minimal games.  I wonder if that is because I
do not enter the UKvsJP with a British car, or even buy any British
car at all?
