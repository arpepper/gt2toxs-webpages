Well, I decided to try the "cheat" North American Concept Car in
an attempt to get the second of the two Castrol Supra GT's which
are prizes in the Grand Valley 300.

The first car I lapped was when I was on lap 6.

I lapped the field three times by lap 30, and it, just barely,
stuck when I came out of the pits.  By the end I had lapped the
field six times.

I had no super-disasters, but a few minor losses of control.
Notice that my slowest laps would make good fastest laps for
some other cars, and even the slowest of my pit laps would
give me pole position.  8-)

I had quite a few 1:28's (early on) and lots of 1:29's and 1:30's.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green 8-) Castrol Supra GT.

It was disappointing not to break 1-30 with this car, nor even to
set a new personal record, but at least it did win the second of
the two prize cars for the event, bringing me closer to collecting
the lot.  In fact, at this point the only race-prize car I had left to
win was the red-orange Soarer in the MegaSpeed event.
