My Almost Total Deconstruction of Gran Turismo 1

I am finished the <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1"
color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> 
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/proper">proper</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/proper.txt">here</a>) and, based on that I feel
I have almost totally deconstructed the game.

Yes, I verified that if you allow yourself to sell prize cars, it is
reasonably easy to complete
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1"
color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> 
simulation mode
doing all the races in proper license order without entering any race
twice.

The tricky part is winning the <b>4WD</b> Cup before you've entered the
big-money races.
But it's not that difficult.
In tests done in the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/fiji">fiji</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/fiji.txt">here</a>) after completion, I found
I could just barely win the series with a roughly Cr50,000 Impreza.
(1994 Impreza Wagon tunes up to the highest power when maxed, and
so is a favourite--it's also one of the cheapest used Subarus available).
(Cr17,500 plus turbo spec 2, soft racing slicks, and hard stabilizers
giving Cr47,800 in total), but, since I ended up with more cash in the
<b>proper</b> game I made the car more than Cr80,000--making it easier
to win this series and also making it better prepared to win the Clubman
and even the GT Cup.  (Principally, I used turbo spec 3 instead of turbo
spec 2; that way I would not need to replace it; I also bought a maxed
muffler as well as a maxed intercooler as well as hard stabilizers).

The <b>Nissan Pulsar '91 GTI-R</b>,
seems like another good possibility for the <b>4WD</b> series
but, although it can be tuned to win the <b>4WD</b> series for about
the same money, it is pretty well maxed then and has little scope
for future racing.

Another thing I did was essentially trade the prize Demio for a used
Mitsubishi FTO GPX.
The latter is only a little more expensive than the Cr12,000 you get
for the Demio, but is more powerful and responds better to tuning money.

By starting with a powerful FR car, I had a reasonable car ready to win the
<b>FR</b> Series.
Starting with a cheap MA70 Supra, which easily wins the Sunday Cup in
stock form, I managed to get all the poles as well by using weight reduction
stage 1 and a racing flywheel.  A further Cr13,500 modifications (Racing
muffler, Turbo Spec 1 and hard semi-racing tires) allowed it to win the
<b>FR</b> Series.

In the
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/proper">proper</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/proper.txt">here</a>)
I also made extensive use of the
<b>Subaru Impreza WRX-STi version III</b>
(prize from the <b>Normal Series</b>) in this game.
It's a wonderful little car in tuned and also in race-modified form.

Cars to win the <b>Normal</b> series are key.

The <b>Viper RT/10</b> is a shoe-in, and also relatively cheap.
It's fun to spend more money if you can get it, and use a <b>TVR</b> or
<b>NSX</b>.  Other options are the <b>Supra '95 RZ</b>, or an <b>Impreza</b>
of some sort, but many people, myself needed, will usually need to ensure
the <b>AI</b> <b>NSX</b> is not in the field.

When you win the <b>Normal</b> Series, you should have about <b>Cr300,000</b>
or more with which to build-up a good car to win the <b>Mega-Speed Cup</b>,
or the <b>International</b> Series (<b>USvsJP</b>, etc) before going on to
the <b>IA</b> level events, for which the only new car you might need
would be one for the <b>Hard-Tuned</b> Series.

In fact, once I've won the <b>Normal</b> Series, I feel like I'm coasting
through the rest of the game, just finishing it up.  This was especially
true in the games where I did not bother finishing in license order.

Sticking to license order, you can run short of money through the
<b>International</b> series, especially if you avoid using prize cars;
in fact to save money I used a tuned <b>Griffith</b> (without race-mod)
for the <b>Mega-Speed</b> Cup as well as the <b>UKvsUS</b> Series,
and later the <b>Hard-Tuned</b> Series and the <b>All-Night I</b>.

On the other hand, if you use the <b>Chaser LM</b> (<b>GT Cup</b> prize)
for several races, it saves a lot of money.  But once you've mastered this
seemingly awkward beast, it does get boring using it in every game.

       I hoped to do this game in 100 days.
       I allowed myself to sell cars, but stipulated that I would not
       obtain my next license until I had finished all events open to
       the previous license.
       It turns out, given licenses obtained in minimal time, possibly
       by reloading, it's relatively easy to do this if you allow yourself
       to sell cars.
