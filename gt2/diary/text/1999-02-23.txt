Observations of License tests and Demios.

Thread: License Test Progress

Well, last night I was just going to do B-5 license test (cornering of
Deep Forest Racing Way hairpin with a fast car) again and again.  I did
not get gold, but did break 24 seconds, versus the 25 required.

I noticed that sometimes fast runs seem to be taking longer because
your brain (and fingers) end up doing more.  I got a reliable silver
technique by never pulling to the right edge of the road, but just
staying in a straight line and cutting in from there.  Of course
this is probably optimizing to the wrong goal.

Thread: Used Car Patterns

I made some more notes about the used car stocking algorithm, but no
startling discoveries.  I think I need to start tracking the pattern
for one particular car.  E.g. the red MA70  8-).  There sure were a
lot of MA70 at day 1600, however.

Thread: Tuning Advice

I broke down, however, and did do some racing.  I decided to see how
well the racing Demio A-spec could be tamed.  It seems that if you
put the spring rate right down, and reduce the dampers, and use
normal "stabilizers", and reduce ground clearance, it begins to
become a civilized car.  But it is still very difficult to win with.

I took it to the Lightweight Battle Stage and lost once, and then got
an undeserved win.  The loss was 3rd-1st-4th.  I nearly beat the
others out in the last race, but as I went to go through their
inside on the last turn I went to fast and lost it.  In the second
race I managed to win at Autumn Ring-Mini ii, and Clubman R5, but then
came only 5th (at the last minute) at DFRW ii.  The other cars are really
vicious against a Demio for some reason.  The only reason I won the
second series was because the two other contenders split their second
and third places, and so went into the last race tied 10 apiece against
my 18.  And I managed to get 2 points for fifth to beat the winner's
19.
