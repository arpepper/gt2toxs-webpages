I really should get into the habit of book-marking pages on the Web
more often.  I know I found a really in-depth discussion of Ducati World
Racing Challenge somewhere which mentioned things like how weird it is to
have one license test where you go crazy trying to cross the rumble-strip
on each corner while another test fails you if you touch the inside. And
it discussed how to make money, how you can't set up reasonable handicaps
in two-player QuickRace mode because both bikes must come from the same
category, how weird AI bikes sometimes seem to enter the races, how race
difficulty isn't strictly related to level (perhaps because the AI never
does upgrades, e.g. for an Advanced Sports Touring race). Etc. Etc. Etc.

But I can't find it now. Nope. Just can't guess the right combo of
keywords, or follow the right link, or something.
