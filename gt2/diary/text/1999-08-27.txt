Nismo GT-R LM (Special Edition) Improves Time at the Grand Valley 300

Since I seem to have improved my Grand Valley 300 ability, I am
gradually re-evaluating all the special models.  The GT-R LM
improved its time by just over three minutes.

Prior to entering the Grand Valley 300, I won the GT-I Cup
with this car, 51 to 37.  I came second at Trial Mountain,
losing there to the GTO twinturbo, but did manage to win 
at Deep Forest, even though I qualified 6th.

I found this car pleasant to drive before, and it was pleasant
this time.

Although I lapped the two last-place cars by lap 10, it didn't stick
though the pit stop.  By lap 24 I finally lapped the field.

I lapped the other GT-R twice by lap 40 (although it didn't
stick, of course), but I did eventually lap it a third time.
I didn't quite manage to lap the Supra GT three times.

I had no major disasters, and only a couple of minor ones.

Most laps were 1:34's and 1:35's.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

Once again, I found this car very pleasant to drive.  Although its
rear-end can be controlled nicely, it does not tend to come
around unexpectedly.
