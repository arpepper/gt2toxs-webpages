Re: Software Defects in PlayStation game "Gran Turismo 2"

To Whom it may concern:

I initially purchased Gran Turismo 2 on December 16, 1999.  That version
had a number of bugs.  Since it generally seemed a good product, and I
had heard that newer versions had the bugs fixed, I actually purchased
another copy on March 4, 2000, since that seemed more convenient than
pursuing the warranty replacement I had heard about.

It turned out, though, that even in my new copy of Gran Turismo 2 the
second disk ("Simulation Mode") still has all the same bugs.

A partial list of problems is:
   inconsistent license requirements shown for "Muscle Car Cup"
   "Normal" Event Generator title is mis-spelled as "Nomal"
   "9th place" 400M Machine Test times can overwrite 1000M records
   Maximum Speeds with a zero after the decimal place are shown incorrectly
         e.g. 152.09mph will be shown as 152.9mph
                 (both in the records and in top right corner)
   sponsor trade mark "Castrol" is mis-spelled as "Castol"
        on the Licenser Credits pages
   "car wash" price is listed as Cr5,000 when in fact it costs Cr50

And, the really serious one:
   if you run the Maximum Speed Test enough times, your garage
   full of cars will become corrupted, and quite likely deleted.

If, after this occurs, the game is saved to a Sony memory card (such as
the model SCPH 1020 I have at home), most of the save information
remains intact, and reloads properly, but the garage comes back as empty,
and some of the Machine Test records are also corrupted.

I phoned Sony technical support at 1-800-745-7669, on or about Tuesday
March 7, 2000, and they advised me that my problems qualify me for a
free replacement under the warranty terms.  They advised me to return
the disk to you, together with the a letter containing my name, address
and phone number, together with the title of the game, and a
description of the problem.  That is what I have done here--It
took me a few days to organize letter and packaging.

They said a replacement disk ("Gran Turismo 2--Simulation Disk") would be
shipped to me by priority mail, and so I look forward to that happening.


                                  Yours truly,
