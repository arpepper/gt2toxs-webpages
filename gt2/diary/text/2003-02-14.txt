In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/mazda">mazda</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/mazda.txt">here</a>),
I used the 1991 FD RX-7 efini Type R for many races.
So I decided to enter the hard-tuned version in
the All-Night I.

I started from pole position, got a good start, and never lost the lead.

I began lapping the cars on lap 12, starting by passing
the pokey Civic.

I had a very fast second shift, with a mediocre first and last shift.
I never seemed to keep as consistently fast as practice suggested I could.

I used much stiffer stabilizers than I had in the tuned series, or on
the race-mod version, but perhaps they were too stiff, since I got
violent pulling to one side occasionally.

I won Cr150,000, and the silver Nismo GT-R LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...

Although I started in first place, I struggled for the first two laps,
finally getting a slim lead on the second-place Skyline.

Two bad accidents on lap 9 and 11 greatly reduced my lead, meaning that
when I went for my pit stop on lap 15 I actually dropped back to 3rd place.
I managed to regain the lead on the road, however, and after that both
cars pitted another time.

I had not more outrageous accidents, and eventually won by a healthy
margin, lapped the EXIV 200GT right near the end of the race, leaving
only two cars finishing on the same lap.

In contrast to many endurance races in Gran Turismo, this one was almost
exciting.  For example, I lapped my first car (the Lantis) while I was
still only in second place.

I won Cr150,000, and a CCCCC Silvia LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
