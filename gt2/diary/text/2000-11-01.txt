Gran Turismo 1 Garage Structure (Game Shark Hints)

Threads:
  Game Shark Hints

<CODES>
I suddenly realized I did not have any diary entry describing the
useful garage and other simulation game related addresses, so I
created this one here.  It contains lots of address I frequently
refer to when using a <b>GameShark</b>.

Disclaimer: Do not use any of these codes unless you know what you are
doing and understand and are willing to take the risks involved.  Even
if you do understand the risks, double-check my numbers if possible.
(E.g. always inspect the value of a location for consistency before
changing it).


Garage Structure:

<HTML INDENT>

<font face="Courier">
<table width=90%>
<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B8F0&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
          a counter of some sort, always increasing in value
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B8F4&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
        this is your money, in Credits
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B8F8&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
<p>
         the current day number
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B908&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
<p>
         zero-origin index of the car you are currently using
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B90A&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
<p>
         number of cars in your garage
</p>
</td>
</tr>


<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009B90C&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
<p>
          At this point you find 100 4-byte quantities.
</p>
<p>
          Each of these is the base value of the car in the corresponding
          garage slot (see below).
</p>
<p>
          These values are stored as the amount in credits, times 100.
          I tend to refer to this measurement as "Yen", since I believe
          the Japanese version of the game uses credit values which are
          100 times those in the North American game.  Alternatively,
          you can think of them as penny values.
</p>
<p>
          When selling a car, you will get 50% of this value from most
          dealers, and 60% from the matching dealer.  If this value is
          zero, the car cannot be sold.  This happens with the B license
          test prize Concept Car.
</p>

</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009BA9C&nbsp;-
</td>
<td>
<p>
          Immediately after that (100 x 4 is 400, or 190 hex), you find
          the 100 garage slot entries describing the cars in your garage.
          I will not attempt to describe the meaning of those in detail
          here.
</p>
<p>
          Each garage slot is 96 bytes long, or 60 in hex.  Somewhat
          conveniently, this is exactly the same amount of data you
          see in each screen of <b>GameShark</b> Memory Editor.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E01C&nbsp;- 
</td>

<p>
         This is the start of the space after the garage.
</p>
</td>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E190&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
         From about here to 8009E3AF is a bitmap representing all
         the parts you have purchased.  I have not managed (nor really
         given a concerted effort) to decode the precise meaning of each entry here.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E444&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
        Here you can see 24 bytes of 1's, 2's, and 3's which clearly
        correspond to you bronze, silver and gold license cups, respectively.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E45C&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
        The license test records are easily observed here.  If you
        patch <b>G.T.Gold</b>'s time at the right time, you can cheat
        your way to a gold medal!
</p>
<p>
        These extend until about 8009E730.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E45C&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
        Start of B license records.
</p>
</td>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E95C&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
        End of IA license records.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
8009E95C&nbsp;- 
</td>
<td>
<p>
        Here you have 22 bytes corresponding to your best place in each of
        the 22 simulation mode events, including the Spot Races.
</p>
<p>
        After that is a lot of weird stuff I couldn't figure out.
</p>

<tr align=top>
<td valign=top>
800A0E74&nbsp;-

<td>
<p>
        It looks like the Simulation Mode Time Trial Records begin here.
