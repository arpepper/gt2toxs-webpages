Thoughts about tuning, when I was asked about NSX bouncing problems

  Tuning Advice


Ahem.  I play a lot, but don't have a lot of talent and have little
theoretical knowledge behind my tuning.  That's why I qualify a lot
of the following with "I think".  8-)

You should refer to:

http://home.att.net/~chmilnir/gt/

which features a tuning guide.

The only NSX I have bought is the special model.  I hated it[*] and did
badly with it.  Yes, lowering the damping usually prevents the bouncing
you describe.  Increasing damping doesn't usually seem to work
properly; I think the game simulation is not so accurate wrt to
dampers, especially with excessively light cars.  This "bouncing"
is not a realistic phenomenon (although it arises because of a need to
visually exagerrate car responses, in order to provide sufficient
feedback).  And, strangely, the bounce seems to occur when the dampers
are *higher*.  And it seems the game does not provide enough resolution
for damper settings; if they had reduced your available gear settings
by a factor of 10, they might have freed up a lot of bits for use in
such things.  8-)

So, in short, I don't know.   8-)

[*]Actually, I sort of like it in the "International" Series; it seemed
very good at SSR11, with near-stock settings.  Although it would bounce
horribly if you did hit the kerbs, the steering was so precise you
could avoid doing so.

I used to use a lot of stabilizer (e.g. 5of5 hard).  The consensus is
that the numbers in all three stabilizers types are the same; soft is
just cheaper, while hard gives you the same choice, and more.  Now I
use less; this generally seems to give cars more grip, making them
slide less soon and thereby increases cornering speed, even though more
body roll on the suspension is visible, especially in replays.  (In
constrast, a car with high stabilizers is like a go-kart, seeming to
slide early, but when learning I found this gave extra feedback).

From what I read other places, (e.g. above) it seems that stabilizers
make suspension "less independent".  But on the other hand, I think
minor problems with the algorithms for depicting the car motion can
make the motions caused by too much stabilizer look like those for
too little.  E.g. with too little stabilizer, you might, in real life,
get an inside wheel lifting without causing roll of the entire car,
(although the body may roll a lot on the suspension) but with too much
stabilizer, an inside wheel lifting will want to make the entire car
roll (I think).  But I think the game's depiction of both situations is
pretty similar, making diagnosis difficult.

So my main hint (in addition to the above URL) is that you,
counter-intuitively, might want to try reducing dampers but leaving the
springs high.  High spring values do not seem to cause as much
oscillation as you would in real-life expect.

I now have one last race-series prize car to win.  The yellow '91
Skyline in the Tuned Series (which I like to refer to as the "Abnormal"
series).

After that I may investigate NSX's more.  Though the first project
would probably be trying a TypeSZero in the Normal Series.
(I don't suppose I'll ever seriously pursue all gold license tests;
that could be very frustrating experience, I think).
