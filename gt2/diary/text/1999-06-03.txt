I finally win a "real" gold medal (for B-7)

  License Test Progress

Last night (early this morning actually) did I get my first "real" gold
(B-7)  (B-1,B-2 and A-7 do not count as "real" gold).  I also got
silver on A-3 and A-7; for some reason I do better with the Griffith
than the Viper.  (And really strangely, the "Normal" series I raced
before that, with the Viper, was "off" by about a second a lap).

Before getting gold on B-7, I got the time "25.768" *three* times (gold
is 25.750).  The interesting thing is that exactly matching a silver
time does seem to give you a "silver prize". (I actually reset the game
so as to save only one of those times).

As seemed to happen a couple of times before, I got gold after almost
resigning myself to not meeting the goal that evening.  My time
was 25.745--it's sort of a strange feeling when you look at the
pass screen, check the number twice and realize "Yes, that's it!",
then press a button and really do get that "Gold Prize".
