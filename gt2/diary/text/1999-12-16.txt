My wife phoned today to say that Electonics Boutique phoned and left
a message saying that the evil item I requested has arrived, and will
be held till Saturday if I phone back.

She had it wrong, actually.   I had to phone if I wanted it held
any longer than Saturday.  Hmm. Let's see.  Two weeks from next Tuesday
might be about right...

Hee.  Hee.  Special trip to Fairview Mall to pick it up tonight.

I used to think that
the "Greatest Hits" version of Gran
Turismo would likely to be complex enough for young children, although the
"this is old stuff" peer pressure may cause them to ignore the game.
There is *so* much to Gran Turismo 2 that you could spend the rest of
your life playing it and not touch it all...   And I've been playing
Gran Turismo 1 too much for almost exactly a year, and still haven't
exhaused it.

But <html><a name="fromstar">I</a></html> sort of take that back.  Gran Turismo 2 is probably better for
youngsters because the license tests (even though there's a lot more of
them) are doubly easier to learn.  The minimum standards seem lower.
It seems you pass when you reach the proficiency which in Gran Turismo
would mean you were close enough to begin working off the last
half-second or so.<html><a href="#star">[*]</a></html>
And on top of that, if you come too close too
many times, you get some sort of (undocumented) "Kiddie's Award" that
might be sufficient for considering the test passed.  I don't know; the
people I know who had got these (  8-) ) always kept going and replaced
them with a proper "bronze".  And in GT1 there were full-lap time
trials for license tests; there are none such in GT2.  Two laps of a
skid-pad, yes, but no laps of road courses.  There's a quite nice
slalom test, and I'm surprised how much fun I found the rally course
tests.  And climbing the bottom of Pike's Peak in a huge wing with a
tiny Suzuki attached to it!  Wow!

Besides that, you really do get two (2) two games in one!  It comes
with two disks, one Arcade and one Simulation, and these could be
used on different PlayStations at the same time.

I may now just never finish my latest game, playing with Nismo
400R, in a game in <html><a href="logs/">logs</a></html> which
I call <html><a href="logs/nismo">nismo</a></html>.

<html><a name="star" href="#fromstar">[*]</a></html>I'm reasonably unco-ordinated, with relatively poor reactions, and
a creature of habit who learns old things thoroughly and new things
slowly, but I passed 48/50 GT2 license tests tonight (early morning),
meaning I've got 4 of 5 possible licenses already, and none of the
tests use the old courses (excepting the drag race ones).
