My nephew makes more progress

On Saturday my eight-year-old nephew gave Gran Turismo another shot,
and caught on much better than before.  He was able to win the
Sunday Cup with a fully race-modified Prelude Vtec I had in my
garage.  He won it several times and looked for a car of his
own.  I suggested an '89 Skyline GT-R, since I knew I would already
have a lifetime supply of parts for it.   8-)  After tuning it
down to about 500bhp, and "loaning" him the credits for
race-modification, he found it quite driveable.  He then insisted on
entering the Sunday Cup enough times to "pay me back" the Cr85,000
for the race-modification.

Gran Turismo is now in "Greatest Hits" pricing here, and so, at my
wife's urging (he's her nephew, really) I bought him a copy.  I'm not
sure how soon we'll get it to him.

I actually got it at from the Canadian Tire store with the auto centre
where I took my old Toyota Tercel wagon for a safety check.  Canadian
Tire seems to be carrying PlayStation stuff once again.

My Impreza should be arriving soon.   8-)
