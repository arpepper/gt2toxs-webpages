Analysis of Yet Another Versions of Gran Turismo 2 CD's Using a PC

I am a strange person.  I bought another copy of GT2, hoping to get
either a more-or-less bug-free version (as indicated by a Cr50
car wash, which apparently correlates to no garage delete bug).

I bought it from Zeller's, a Canadian store.

Now, what is odd is that this seems to have the Arcade Mode Disk from
my Toys 'R Us version, but the Simulation Mode disk from my original
buggy version.  I'll leave you to do your own speculation about that.
My original assumption was that the Zeller's stock had been around
since just after Christmas, but now I'm not so sure.

This should mean that Time Trial times saved using that Arcade Mode
Disk will not show up properly when viewed as "track records" on
the Simulation Mode Disk, even when using both disks from the same
box.  That is deplorable, but jives with reports I have heard from
others.

By the way, over the weekend I was able to provoke the garage delete
bug with both my original and my "somewhat fixed" version.  However,
when using the "somewhat fixed" version, I did start with a save created
by the old version.  Memory examination with a Game Shark Pro suggests
that that shouldn't make any difference, however.

At least now, having two copies of the original Simulation Disk, I can
contemplate trying to get Sony to send me a replacement.  Especially
since I have managed to destroy my garage a number of times.   8-)
