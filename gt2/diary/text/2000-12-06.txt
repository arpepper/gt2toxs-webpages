(Gran Turismo 1) Hints for Winning the Gold Medal for B-3

I had reason to review my replay and formulate advice for this notorious
licence test.

It took me ages to find my B-gold replays last night, but eventually I
did.
                                      
To demonstrate my level of persistence, here are my replay titles:

That's playing almost every evening and a lot on weekends. Anyway, the
description in the earlier posting pretty much describes my replay.
Now, I used analog gas and brake all the time, with manual
transmission mapped to R1 and R2. (In one <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">2</font> test with an
underpowered car on a circle pad I did switch to digital throttle to
get gold).
                                      
In general, it looked like I pinned the tach before the start (after a
little "warming up" by alternating of revs--I really don't know if the
game does "warm up" the engine or not). And I always shifted up after
the redline. I downshifted almost immediately after beginning the
turn, but did no powerslide, since the car has no power!
                                      
I barely touched the outside rumble strip on entrance to the turn (I
believe the non-gold demo goes right up on it), and stayed just clear
of the inside rumble-strip at the apex. I hit a peak speed of 87 mph
before turning, which slowed me down, after which I quickly
downshifted (at about 80mph). I used all the road on my gradual exit,
and ran off the road after the finish line. My lowest speed through
the corner was 63mph. I'm reasonably sure I used no brakes (no
lights), but can't remember and the replays don't really reveal the
extent to which I may have feathered the throttle while slowing down.
                                      
My actual shift points were:

Unlike with a powerful car, your racing line should be almost
symmetric around the turn (apex in the center). (With a powerful car,
you want to enter such a turn deep so that you can apex late and
thereby have more time to accelerate (because of the flatter exit
curve). It's debateable how much that would help even with a powerful
car in this particular scenario, since the finishing straight might be
too short to allow increased acceleration and speed to offset extra
time spent in the corner).

Oh yes. My biggest gold medal hint.
