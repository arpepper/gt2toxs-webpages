JavaScript Pages to Help Compare Cars and Locate Used Cars

I spent a couple of weeks working on JavaScript pages to perform selective
queries of <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1"
color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> car data.

The pages <a href="../gt1stats">gt1stats</a> and <a href="../gt1used">gt1used</a>
contain JavaScript utilities which, if you have a suitable browser,
will allow you to search for cars available in 
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1"
color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>.

<a href="../gt1stats">gt1stats</a> is generally more useful, since it
contains more information for each car, and stats for new cars.
Since it contains information for used cars up to only day 100, the
table of data is actually smaller than the other page, and so the
whole thing tends to work faster.  (In fact, I do also include a
few used cars appearing after day 100, so as to document the first
appearance of each car of each colour).

<a href="../gt1used">gt1used</a>, however, is the result of my analysis
of the raw information contained on the game <b>CD</b> and contains
information for all 60 used car lineups.  (The lineups are for day
0 (i.e. day 1), up to day 590, each one lasting for 10 days.
On day 600, the used car inventory repeats with the day 0 cycle,
and so-on).  For the way this is stored (actually in-line in
the JavaScript), it is rather a large amount of data, and so the page
is rather slow, but it is amusing to peruse it every now-and-then.
