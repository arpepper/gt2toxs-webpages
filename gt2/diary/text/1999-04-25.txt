Well, the last special model to try was the Castrol Supra GT, which
I had purchased in the tasteful white colour scheme.  To warm up,
I took it to UKvsJP several times, where it seemed well suited to
SSR5.  I entered five times.

1st time;  one non-pole (SSR11),  45to25,  green Cerbera
2nd time;  q1st 1:15.712rec SSR5,  1st close to rec,  45to28,  red del Sol

This is definitely a recommended ride for this event.

Once again, I led from start to finish, never losing the lead, not even
for pit stops.  However, the field was extremely uncompetitive,
although the AI GT-R LM did  go a little faster this time.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

To further test my endurance, I entered the event again, with one
of my favourite cars, the race-modified Cerbera.  Now I have
finished all the special models, I am working my way through my
garage and plan to try all apparently competitive race modified cars,
all LM prize cars, and probably even the tuned '95 GTO MR.

Before the GV300, the race-modified Cerbera won UKvsJP 42 to 29
(crashing at the chicane in SSR5), and won a green Cerbera (of
course).

I jostled for the first four laps, and then led to the finish.  Note that
this car is easy on tires and so I took one fewer pit stop, and even
pushed past the schedule at lap 45.  It looked like I would end up
behind the lapped GT-R if I pulled in at lap 45, since I had only just
lapped him when he pitted.  Furthermore, it looked like I might end up
in the middle of other traffic, so, since I could still gain about two
seconds a lap even as the tires were, I stayed out to pass the traffic
before rather than after, sort of.

I had at least one disaster in this race.

I won Cr300,000 plus a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.
