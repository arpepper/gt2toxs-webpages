In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/gt1-24hour">24hour</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/gt1-24hour.txt">here</a>),
I used the FCRX7 for many races.
So I decided to enter the race-modified version in
the Grand Valley 300.

Starting from fourth place, I moved relatively quickly into second place
during the first lap (the NSX had its characteristic wipe-out on the
run to the second hairpin, and I managed to avoid a collision with it).

I slowly gained on the leading Skyline, and took the lead, but then
had a mishap on lap 8 at the first hairpin which dropped me back once again.
But I did actually manage to gain the lead on the road by my first
pit stop.

My first pit stop dropped me to second place, but I gained the lead
when the first-place car (probably the NSX?) pitted.

On my other two stop, I kept the lead.

Towards the end of the race I diced with the second and third place car
as I came up to lap them.  I eventually managed to keep both of them
lapped at the finish.

This result was slightly slower (17 seconds) than a previous time I ran
this race with this car.  Considering that was over three years ago,
that is mildly perplexing!  I was possibly tired because this was the
culmination of a long day of racing.  Perhaps also significant was the
fact that last time I took four pit stops instead of three.

Actual total count, at 800BDB74, was 005BFA5B, or 6027837 thousandths
of seconds.  So the above is exactly right.

Basically, most settings are maximized or minimized as appropriate.
