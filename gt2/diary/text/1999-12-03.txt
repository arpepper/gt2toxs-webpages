I Actually Get All Golds on My B License and Win the Concept Car!

Threads:
  License Test Progress

Well, if you've been keeping track, I was down to needing only
B-6 and B-8 to get all golds on my B license.

Well, today I did it, relatively quickly.

After repeatedly trying B-6, a run through the esses at High Speed Ring
with a Mitsubishi FTO GP version R, I eventually got a feel for where
speed could be gained, and exceeded the standard of 26.350 with
26.309--previous best was 26.412 , also set today.

After that I idly tried my B-8 test, the lap of the High Speed Ring
with a Mazda Eunos.  It didn't seem to take that long before I was
beating my previous best (of about 1:19.8),  and in the wee hours
of the morning I managed 1:19.255, not as good as the demo which
is a 1:18, but good enough to beat the 1:19.500 required for
gold and get the "You Have a New Car!" screen!  The practice for
the previous test seemed to help with B-8, since it stresses one
of the trickier parts of the course.

I haven't really done anything with the stock Concept Car yet.  Well, I
verified that you can clone it for zero cost, but cannot get rid of
them from your garage.  (Used car dealers refuse to buy it!)  So I
made a couple of backup copies, and must sometime sell some other
car from my "main" garage to make room for any new prizes.
