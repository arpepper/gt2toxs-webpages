In the <html><a href="logs/hastings">hastings</a></html> game I
decided to use the Cerbera LM to win the Grand Valley 300, and
did a reasonably fast time, though not a Personal Best.  It now
ranks as the second fastest car, though.  It's been a long time
since I raced the Cerbera LM at this race actually, and I was
glad to have won this car in this game so I had a good excuse
to see how I could do with it now.

I led from start to finish again, in a fairly uneventful race.

This was about four minutes slower than the Concept Car, but I still
lapped the field four, not quite five, times.

I lapped the first car on lap 7, and was catching the second and
third place cars when I stopped at lap 12 for my first pit stop.
I lapped the field by lap 15.

I lapped them twice by lap 24, but, since I had to stop for my second
pit stop, it didn't stick.  The exact same thing happened with my stops
on lap 36 and 48; I almost wondered if I could have saved a few seconds
by stopping early, but then I would have had to have paid for it with
a long last shift, or something similar.  I did not lose very much
time repassing the cars anyway.

On lap 60, I did not quite manage to catch the leaders again, and, as
the finishing intervals indicate, I managed to lap them not quite five
times.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

Although 4 minutes slower than what I managed with the Concept Car, this
time is faster than the <html><em>first</em></html> time I managed with
the Concept Car, and this is the first car I have managed that with.
The time was almost two minutes faster than the times I set with
the two Griffiths, and the RX7 LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 60 lap times...

This gearing has the same range as stock, but is smoothed out a bit.
Actually, the top three gears overlap so closely that it confuses
the automatic shifting algorithm in the game...

I raised the final drive (lowered its number) at bit.  I forgot
to smooth out 4th,5th and 6th as I had done the previous night
actually, when practising in my main game with a Cerbera LM at
the GT-I Cup.
