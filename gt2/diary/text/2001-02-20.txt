(GT2 Version 1.2) Brief Memory Map for GameShark Use

Here is a brief memory map of locations I found by inspecting the
version 1.2 simulation mode disk copy of Gran Turismo 2.

People have observed that most of these locations are merely
shifted by hex 5A0 from the locations for Gran Turismo 2 "version 1.0",
the original very buggy release.

This version shows IA only above the Muscle Car Cup on the page
under Special Events.

This version spells "Normal" correctly for the Event Generator.

This version shows a Cr50 car wash.<html><br></html>

This version no longer has the garage delete bug.

<pre>
801C99D8 - A. day counter (as you see in bottom-left corner)
801C99E0 - B. total races
801C99E4 - C. total wins
801C99E8 - D. total "positions" or "rankings"
801C99EC - E. total races not including abandons
     D/E does appear to equal "average ranking"
801C99F4 - total prize money
</pre>

Following this appears to be various "nybble maps" probably
representing license status, plus various records, probably
license and maybe Time Trials.

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801CD4B0 - # of max speed records
801CD4B4 - 8 max speed records, 20 bytes each
              car(4b),speed*100(4b),name(12b)

801CD554 - garage count (number of cars)
801CD558 - first car of 100 car garage
</pre>
</HTML>

Soon after the end of the garage is...

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801D1568 - number of credits in your bank account
801D156C - zero-origin index of current car in garage
801D156F - last name used for records, e.g.  ARP20Feb01
</pre>
</HTML>

Most, if not all, of these locations are hex 5A0 greater than the
version 1.0 locations, I believe.
