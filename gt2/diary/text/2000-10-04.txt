A Few Cheats For V-Rally 2

It's strange that I've never managed to mention V-Rally 2 here.
I played it quite a bit a few months ago, and was really very
impressed.  All-in-all, I find it more fun than Colin McRae
Rally.

Anyway, I want to record here a few useful V-Rally 2 cheats for safe-keeping.

Here are some GameShark Codes I found by using the World Wide Web.
(<html><a href="http://www.altavista.com/">www.altavista.com</a></html>, actually).
