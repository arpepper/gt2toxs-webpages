Thread: Prize Car Information

This Silvia is a delight to drive.  Although the engine sound is
whiney, acceleration is reasonable, and control through steering and
throttle is predictable.  I actually posted a slightly better time
than I did with the FTO LM, which is by many recommended highly for
this race.

Tomorrow's GV300 entrant will hopefully be  [R]NSX-R LM GT2 (i.e. Honda
Special Model), so I raced it today in UKvsJP for practice.  I lost TM
(came 4th), but won the rest, winning 39 to 28.  This is an easy car to
screw up the settings on.  It seems to contradict Jet Jaguar's
assertions that the overly "stabilized" end of the car is the one which
will lift a wheel, too; it seems to lift a rear wheel if you run with
lower rear than front stabilizer.

The view from behind of this car is not very good.  Even standing
still, it doesn't look very realistic, and the portrayal of the
handling reminds one of earlier racing games where your car
more-or-less rotated, as if on a slot-car peg, when you steered, so
that it would (or would not) stay on the road which ribboned towards
it.

However, the car does handle well.  It seems especially sensitive to
running over obstacles, such as the rumble strips inside turns, but
on the other hand you can make it avoid them with a precision you
don't even try to attain with other cars.  (Okay, *I* don't even
try to attain with other cars).
