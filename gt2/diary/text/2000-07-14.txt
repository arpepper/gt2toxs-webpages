(GT2)  Evolution of a GameShark Code, Part I

 Game Shark Hints

I wanted to create a GameShark Code for <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html> which
would cause you to win as prize cars hybrids constructed from your garage.
These codes will only possibly work for <html><b>GameShark Version 3.00</b></html>
or higher.

Here is the first step, a code to cause you to win as a prize-car a new
copy of the first car in your garage.  The first version is for the
original 1.0 North American version of <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html>:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C21CCFB8 00A4 -- copies garage slot #1 to prize location (1.0)
 101D502C 0000
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

I have worked extensively with later derived versions of the 1.0 code.
I have not actually test any of the other versions, yet.  I would expect
them to work, and would not be greatly afraid to try them--I just have
not got around to it.

For North American Version 1.1:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C21CD328 00A4 -- copies garage slot #1 to prize location (1.1)
 101D539C 0000
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

For North American Version 1.2:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C21CD558 00A4 -- copies garage slot #1 to prize location (1.2)
 101D55CC 0000
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

For PAL version (should work, based on the known offset):

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C21CD588 00A4 -- copies garage slot #1 to prize location (PAL)
 101D55FC 0000
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

For Japanese version (I've seen this offset, but it would be nice if
someone could test it--be warned):

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C21CD9B8 00A4 -- copies garage slot #1 to prize location (Japanese?)
 101D5A2C 0000
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

So, after developing this code principle, I later went on to arrange
to copy different pieces of different garage slots into the prize car
location, so that the car to be won would be a hybrid.
