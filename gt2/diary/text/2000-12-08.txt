<CODES>
All this information is for <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> version 1.1.

The string <b>USEDCAR</b> occurs at 800C4418.  Then comes the
following:
</CODES>
<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
800C4420  00 00 06 00  00 01 00 00
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>
<CODES>
Following that are 59 more 4-byte quantities representing offsets for
60 10-days cycles, relative to 800C4414.  The first such offset,
at 800C4424, above, is 0100 hex, or 256.  Thus the first set of used car
lots begins at 800C4414 + 0100 hex, or 800C4514:
<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
800C4510  A8 60 00 00  0D 00 00 00
800C4518  D5 02 12 64  0C 03 14 62
800C4520  16 03 15 62  A2 02 12 6C
800C4528  20 03 12 C4  7B 05 13 D8
800C4530  6E 05 13 6C  16 05 13 C4
800C4538  F7 05 07 68  33 06 13 62
800C4540  59 06 0A CA  75 0B 0F 6C
800C4548  41 0B 0F C4  1F 00 00 00
800C4550  AA 01 35 68  F9 01 35 6C
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>
<CODES>

Each lot consists of a 4-byte count, followed by that many 4-byte
structures representing the cars.
Each 4-byte "car" structure has:

</CODES>
<HTML INDENT>
<dl>
<dd>PP PP GG CC</dd>
<dd><dl>
<dd>PP PP - 2 byte price, divided by 10</dd>
<dd>GG - 1 byte "garage code"</dd>
<dd>CC - 1 byte colour, but not like in garage</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</HTML>
<CODES>
The colour code is more like that used in <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">2</font>.
Odd (non-even) values seem to cause the car to disappear from its lot.
Valid values seem to be even values from about hex 60 to about E2.

In the above fragment from the beginning of the lots, you can see that
<b>Toyota</b> has 0D, or 13 cars available.  The code 12 is the MA70
Supra 3.0 GT Limited.  You can see that it occurs above in the colours 64,
6C, and C4.  Following the last <b>Toyota</b> is the 1F indicating the
31 cars available in the Nissan lot.

Valid colour codes seem to consist of a first digit of 6, C, D or E,
and an even second digit (0,2,4,6,8,A,C, or E).  This gives 32 likely
colour combinations for each car.

Here are some examples.

The <b>FTO LM</b> usually shows up as black in the lots, but the colour
<b>D8</b> will make it green (so, interestingly enough, will <b>98</b>).

The <b>Silvia LM</b> usually shows up as red in the lots, but the colour
<b>D6</b> will make it green (so, interestingly enough, will <b>96</b>).

The <b>Cerbera LM</b> usually shows up as burgundy in the lots, but the colour
<b>DA</b> will make it green.

The 560ho <b>Concept Car</b> usually shows up as yellow in the lots,
but the colour <b>EA</b> will make it purple.

I looked around, but did not manage to find where the set of valid
colours for each car is kept in memory.

800586D8 is definitely the index of the current colour being viewed.
(The number which will be put into the colour nybble in the garage
entry).

Here are the colours for the <b>MA70 Toyota Supra 3.0 GT Limited</b>.

I determined this by searching visually in later days for the colour
codes, and trying each of them.

If you view that particular car in the Subaru Special Model Showroom, that
will tells you that it has exactly six colours.

<font size="+1" color="red">Sorry, the original version of this page had
the addresses wrong.  I have corrected it now.  I had 8008 all over the
place where I should have had 800C.</font>
