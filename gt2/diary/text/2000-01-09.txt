To Enjoy Gran Turismo 2 More, Use LSD

To increase your enjoyment of Gran Turismo 2, it helps to use LSD.
Limited-Slip Differential settings, that is.

I had experimented with the expensive Cr50,000 "Traction Control System"
(TCS), mostly on the monstrous Speed 12, with inconclusive results.
It seemed to make the car vaguely difficult to control, as opposed
to impossible to control with out it.

However, with two rear-wheel drive cars LM prize cars, I got much
better and more noticeable results by tweaking the limited-slip
differential which comes on all LM cars.

For both the Cerbera LM, and the new Concept Car LM, when I slid the
"Limited Slip Initial" slider to the max, the cars behaved a lot
better--accelerating, braking and cornering like in GT1.

I have not yet experimented with the other limited slip settings, but
left theme where they were.  My guess is that, for rear-wheel drive
cars, decreasing those settings will increase the induced oversteer
under the relevant conditions.  The defaults are about half-way,
allowing some induced oversteer due to acceleration, but not a lot.

Some time I must go back to the Speed 12, and see how well it behaves
if I use this technique.
