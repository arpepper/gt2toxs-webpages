A Few Ducati World Racing Challenge Hints

Well, it really does seem that
Ducati World Racing Challenge is becoming an alternate addiction.

I've been playing quite a lot in the past couple of weeks.

Here's a few hints I've learned.

The easiest way to make lots of money is almost a cheat.  First get
to where there's enough money for a semi-decent bike and then you can
keep repeatedly winning it from yourself until you can afford a 150,000
superbike and get money in 75,000 chunks.  (save over the "loser" game
with the winner game, and you can boost your cash since both memory
cards then have the same value).

If you don't like the idea of using 2 player mode to boost your cash
(or to get you to the stage where you can) then to make money racing, try
the Monster Cityfun race early on. Later try the TT1 F1 and TT2 F1 races.

I just finally got my Advanced License on the weekend. Then a 20-lap
Sports Touring race at Northstar (?) seems to be a shoe-in. (The
20-lap Supermono on the reverse of the same track is a bit of
challenge, but I finally beat it too). Still only 20,000 for winning.
So I made most of my 1,000,000+ by "cheating" in 2-player mode. The
game did strange things on the weekend though. Thought it was from
sharking the first time, but later, yes, in the TT2 F1 race at the
tricky, bumpy, Borealis II circuit there was
definitely an AI TT1 F1 (which is a bit faster). No sharking involved
that time. (No semi-illicit Fogarty 996 had been bought either).

The most frustrating thing is learning the bumps.
You learn to take one corner faster, and then you're over the
threshold for the bump in the next straight, and it starts dumping
you. Some bumps work if you just let up, but not if you're heading
downhill (e.g. at Borealis II in the TT2 F1 race). For that one you
have to slow, and then be accelerating slightly over the bump in order
to have the right stability.  Eventually learn how to use the rear brake
to help stabilize yourself, too.

I really should get into the habit of book-marking pages on the Web
more often.  I know I found a really in-depth discussion of Ducati World
Racing Challenge somewhere which mentioned things like how weird it is to
have one license test where you go crazy trying to cross the rumble-strip
on each corner while another test fails you if you touch the inside. And
it discussed how to make money, how you can't set up reasonable handicaps
in two-player QuickRace mode because both bikes must come from the same
category, how weird AI bikes sometimes seem to enter the races, how race
difficulty isn't strictly related to level (perhaps because the AI never
does upgrades, e.g. for an Advanced Sports Touring race). Etc. Etc. Etc.

But I can't find it now. Nope. Just can't guess the right combo of
keywords, or follow the right link, or something.
