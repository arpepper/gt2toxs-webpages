Race-modded Cerbera Wins at Grand Valley

Well, a race-modded Cerbera is one of my favourite cars to drive in
the Grand Valley 300, partly because it is so easy on tires, so I
decided to use it to try and get the second of the two Supra GT's
awarded as prizes in the Grand Valley 300.

I had lapped a few cars by my first pitstop.

I had one unusual mishap, and a couple of minor ones.

I just lapped the GT-R LM one more time in the last lap.

I recorded lots of lap times of 1:35.XXX

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue  8-(  Castrol Supra GT.

My time was a lot better than I previously managed with this car.
That somewhat made up for the disappointment of not getting the
second prize car in the second attempt at this race.
