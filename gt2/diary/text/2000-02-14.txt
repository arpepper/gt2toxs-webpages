Confessions of a Delinquent Diarist

Threads:
 Gran Turismo 2
 Car Information

Well, every now-and-then I look at our access logs, and I see a few
people read these ramblings!

Last week I changed the meta headers, so search engines will only
examine the indexes, and not any daily entries--trying to reduce my
hits per day, you see.

Well, I've not been making many diary entries lately, have I?  Though
for those who truly enjoy boring detail, you might have noticed that
my game log, <html><a href=/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/gt2-tm30">here</a></html> keeps growing.  I finally had to sell
some of my duplicate prizes in that game!  Note that I am attempting
to win all the GT League and Special Event races without entering
any event twice.  Quite do-able, as long as you win the Trial Mountain
30 on your first racing day.  The<html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/garage?garage=gt2-tm30&simday=">
garage</a></html> is getting full, especially
since I'm picking up nearly every interesting historical used car
I see.

On the weekend I showed my wife the write-up for the Aston Martin
DB6.  If you haven't read that yet, and want a chuckle, you should
read it.  She insisted I try the beast, so I bought one and
entered it completely stock in the Tahiti race of the Sunday "Cup".
Its handling was very reminiscent of the 1967 Corvette from GT1.
I was thankful that the edges of that track are much more forgiving
than they would be if GT2 was more realistic.

I'm thinking of starting a proper "car review" section.  I think
I'd back my evaluations up with hard figures derived from a lap
at Grand Valley.

I also have a prototype<html><a href="../gears/gears.html">
gear chart</a></html> maybe you'd like to try.  Hmm.  I wonder
if anyone will be able to figure it out.

I've half-a-mind to start a best-times section, for Enduros only.

Thread: Crash Bandicoot

Last weekend, my wife and I gave her younger nephew Crash Team
Racing, complete with a Sony multi-tap, and two really cheap
analog controllers from Wal-Mart.  I won't mention "Bloody Roar II",
because that's bloody embarassing.  He had actually asked for that,
and his mother, a little opposed to the addiction of racing games,
I think, seemed to prefer he get that instead of Crash Team Racing.  We
ended up giving him both.  Nice costumes and choreography in
Bloody Roar II, I must say.  Luckily his parents are quite
open-minded about their children's exposure to such things.
