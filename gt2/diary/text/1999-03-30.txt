Um,

2268lb  1065kg      2.13 lb/kg
1329lb   890kg      1.49 lb/kg
2753lb  1230kg      2.23 lb/kg
1984lb   960kg      2.06 lb/kg

in the case of the Skyline, one of you might have forgotten a flywheel
or driveshaft, or something.

But with the others, there are no weight modifications allowed.

Using 2.204 lb/kg, European numbers become

  1065kg      2347lb(2268)
   890kg      1962lb(1329)
  1230kg      2711lb(2753)
   960kg      2115lb(1984)

So, the numbers do not match exactly, but the 560bhp Concept Car is
much heavier.  And the Viper GTS-R is a teensy bit lighter.  And
the Cerbera LM significantly, but not drastically, heavier.  But
then again, gravity might be different in the European model.
(That might affect comparison of US Cerbera vs European Cerbera,
but would not affect relative values of different European models).

Okay, so let's say the Cerbera LM weighs "one unit":

Then:
                   U.S.       E.U.
'89 GTS-R         1.143      1.109
[R]Concept Car    0.700      0.927
[R]Viper GTS-R    1.388      1.281
[R]Cerbera LM     1.000      1.000

So there is no consistency of the relative values either.
Inspection suggests picking no other vehicle for "1.000" will produce
anything like consistent results, either.

It looks like the European values are rounded to the nearest 5 or 10
kg, (11 or 22lb!), but that alone doesn't explain the inconsistency
either, even assuming the Concept Car is different.
