In the <html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/lancer">lancer</a></html> game I
used the Lancer Evolution IV GSR (4WD Series prize) as much as possible, so I entered the
race-modified version in the Grand Valley 300.

I got the lead by the first corner, and the race was effectively
over.  The field was not super-fast, but was reasonably fast, and
my winning time was sufficient to beat (and lap) any field I have ever seen.

Not only that, I beat another Lancer Evolution IV GSR by several laps.
8-)  I even used the same horsepower.

At my first pit stop, I had a good lead, and never lost the lead,
and I lapped the Impreza (not to mention the Accord and Lancer)
before half-way, although the Impreza did get by me while I was
in the pits.

At my second stop, I was actually beginning to lap the front of the
field, but in fact I lapped the Supra by about lap 40, shortly before
my third stop.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 60 lap times...
