Buy Code Car From Toyota New Car Lineup, Page 1
For NTSC Version 1.0 (garage FB8, offset 0, tested)

Many thanks and acknowledgements to the people who made all the discoveries
that enabled me to work this code out.  Especially the people who created
the "used car lot" purchase codes, and the "buy anywhere" codes upon
which this code is based.

If you activate this code, then when you go to the Toyota dealer, New
Cars, page 1, the first car actually available will be the
Spoon S2000 (B license prize).

You can put any car code you want in place of the S2000 code.

The names on the page will still be the regular Toyota ones, but you
will notice that the one price is unusual. When you select it, the
code car will be available for purchase, and, if the car is available
in different colours, the correct choice of colours will be presented
for you.

The only disadvantage is that you must buy the car for its full "book
value".

You can extend this code to display 7 code cars at once by replicating
the above, but replacing 801C3328/801C332A with

801C30B0/801C30B2

801C3148/801C314A
801C3194/801C3196
</pre></font></tt>

along with more corresponding car codes.

The eighth car location is used in the <b>D0</b> code to guard the
codes.  The memory is used for other stuff at other times, and you
really want to avoid overwriting it blindly.
