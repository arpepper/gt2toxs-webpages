Winning a lot of the International Prize LM Cars.

Well, this weekend I won several of the nifty prize cars, by doing the
international series.

The first time I tried the UKversusJapan, with my race modified
(Castrolized?) Cerbera, I lost to an absolutely identical-looking
Cerbera.  This is the first time I have seen the computer generate
an identical opponent in a series, although I think occasionally
back in my days of Spot Races another red Supra MA70 would show up.
But that's not as distinctive as the two-tone racing Cerbera.

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

Eventually I got my footing, and the Cerbera won a Cerbera.  (green).
Winning that car is the object of the game, isn't it?  It sure seems
like it.  Before driving it, I think I humiliated myself with the
Viper in the Normal Car series.  I humiliated myself with several
cars in the Normal Car series last weekend.  But I remember driving
the Cerbera and thinking "this car is on rails"; I think that was
partly because of the comparison with the Normal Car series.  I
managed to get the Viper to third in the Normal Car series, but
other attempts (Griffith, Impreza Mitsubishi GTO 4WD) failed
miserably.  Notice how the Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo series of
cars say "276bhp" on the showroom, but "311bhp" after you've bought
them?  A nice change from the Subarus which seem to lose about
6bhp after you buy them.

I wish there was a series with cars of the same caliber as the Normal
Car Series, but which had shorter races.  One observation of the Normal
Car series which I did make with the Griffith on the Mini Ring was that
the cars do not try hard to keep you lapped.  (I spun out early and got
lapped on lap 4, but got back ahead and the leader stayed behind).

In addition, I wish there was a series of 5 lap races which was not
as intense as the Normal Car Series.  Doing the Normal Car Series
can literally give me a headache.

I used the prize Cerbera, I think, to win the UK versus US series,
winning the green Castrol RX7.  (Seems ironic, since it's neither
American nor English).  I brought out the 900hp Skyline to win the
Japan vs US series, winning a white Viper with blue stripes.  It's good
to have a couple of Vipers in your garage.  To vipe your vindshield.

I think acceleration burbling, noticeable in all LM cars, and large
American cars, may be the game punishing you for not warming up
properly before the start.  I now think dutifully doing that warm up
may be essential to really good license times, etc.  I.e. presumably
the game punishes you, albeit less dramatically, even with less
powerful cars.  I did a silver time for B-8, that leaves only B-3 at
bronze.  I discovered you *can* do a bronze B-3 (Deep Forest Haipin)
without brakes, but am not sure how that info relates to doing a really
fast time.  I think B-3 is the hardest B test both to get silver, and
even to get bronze, and I'm not sure that's great game design, since
it can make for early discouragement.  I suppose it's a relief when
the other tests are easier.  And you are allowed to take them early,
so...

Silly stuff I did included taking the prize Cerbera to put some
decent records on the Spot Races.  I guess they are easier than
the Sunday Cup, in terms of times, but I think the other cars
in the Sunday Cup try a little harder to let you win if you
are close.  The silliest thing was when I took the 900hp Skyline
to the High Speed Ring Spot Race, and got the pole even after
spinning out on the last corner when qualifying.  So I did the
race over, and demolished the records nicely.  Slightly less
silly was taking this thoroughbred racing machine to sweep the
FR series.  It's fun setting decent track records, but I wish
they were accessible without entering the series.  Also, the info
from other series should be available in all series.

Speaking of letting you win.  I took the prize Cerbera to the UK/Japan
series, trying to win for a second time.  I thought I was going to
lose.  I forgot where I was on Trial Mountain II and wiped out badly on
the tricky sharp left-hander.  I never recovered, finishing 6th.  I
cleaned up okay on SS R5 and HSR.  But then I was doing nicely at GVE
II, but a little worried about the guy right behind me, who wasn't a
contender anyway, so I lost control on the very last hairpin.  I didn't
spin, but went off into the gravel, and lost 4 positions finishing
5th.  So, the series leading RX7 has 22 points to my 21 going into the
dreaded SS R11.  Even the fact it has so few points is an indication
they try to help you win.

Anyway, on R11 I have my usual share of minor disasters for that
course.  Attempting to go slowly through that awful chicane and getting
spun around by a rear-ending computer car (they have impeccable night
vision, of course) usually happens at least once.  But I keep
soldiering on, having learned a reasonable rhythm for the first set of
twiddlies after turn 2 (the sharpish one with the red barriers) which
allows me to keep picking off the opposition.  Now I noticed the RX7
poking around a little near the back of the pack.  That's good, I
thought.  I just need to finish with one car between him and me, and I
get two more points and can win the series without even winning the
race.   I manage to stay calm, and even take second on the finishing
straight, and sure enough, I win the series.  The RX7 finished 5th
in the race.

But I win an identical Cerbera.  Not even a purple one.  But, being
a millionaire now  8-), I don't bother selling the car, but keep it
for reference.  (I.e. settings).  If I win a purple one, I guess
I'll sell this second green one.  Or maybe I'll just donate it to
the Salvation Army.  The tax deduction should be worth more than
what the TVR dealer will give me.

Probably some weekend I'll take my million and use it to "borrow" the
$500K Special Models (ie. test drive them, but not save the game).

Actually, one would think you could take cars for a test-drive without
buying them; perhaps to the test centre and to Autumn Mini time trial.
(results could be not saved unless you actually own the car).  But
perhaps that's a North American culture thing.  Perhaps in Japan you
buy cars without test driving them.  Of course, they'd have to
decide whether you could test drive cars you didn't have the money
for.   8-)  Actually I did do some test-driving when trying to
compare 4wd Normal Cars (in vain, of course), since I didn't want too
many in my garage and/or to donate too much to the Auto Dealers'
Charity.  Way back when I first started playing the game I did one set
of several days using a Toyota Corolla Levin which I never saved.
After that I bought a Supra MA70 which is apparently one of the good
choices.  So I guess one does have a test drive option, but it is
a hassle.

Pole times for Megaspeed Cup seem to be easier to get as event
progresses, so I think required time is somewhere around 51 seconds,
versus the 56 which is easy enough to beat in the other direction.

Actually, in several of the series the races seem to get easier as you
move through the series, as if they've tuned the game for "come from
behind" excitement.  A big exception, right now, seems to be the
several series which end with SSR11, but it feels like perhaps that
track is just difficult to learn, and the competition is not
difficult, per se.  (Except for their night-vision advantage).
Besides, you've often got the series wrapped up by then, anyway.  8-)
