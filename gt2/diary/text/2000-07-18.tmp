Good news:

Well, now having a better copy of the GameShark Pro manual than I
originally got, I managed last night to figure out how to clone codes.
I re-learned about the memory card save capability. I used a similar
method to separate all my Granturismo2 codes into Granturismo2-1.0,
Granturismo2-1.1, Granturismo2-arc1.0 and Granturismo2-arc1.1.

You can edit the game name when you edit the codes. When you exit and
save that code, it changes the game name for all codes in that game--I
never tried to see what happens if the game name previously existed.

Okay, so to clone a code into a new one for modification, use the
following method:

Edit any code and change the game name to something temporary. E.g.
granturismo2-temp. After you exit and save, while you are viewing the
list of games with this temporary name highlighted, press the select
key. This brings up a menu that allows you to save the selected games
GameShark codes to a memory card. Use that option to save the codes for
the temporary game name to a memory card.

Warning: The GameShark will very happily overwrite previously saved
codes without telling you. If I get a chance I will see whether or not
using shorter game names allows multiple code sets to be saved on one
card. Also, the GameShark has more than usual trouble finding memory
cards, so you may have to retry, jiggle them, switch them to the other
slot, etc.

Now, edit a code in the game again, and restore the name, e.g. back to
granturismo2. Now, after you exit and save back to the game name list,
press the select key again, and use the Load Codes option. You will now
have two games with identical codes, but different names.
(granturismo2 and granturismo2-temp)

Go into the temporary game, delete all codes you do not want to clone,
and change the name of codes you do want to clone. (Be sure to change
the names of the codes you do keep). Then save the codes for that
temporary game name to a memory card. (If at all possible, use a
different memory card so that the original set you saved will remain
available in case you make a boo-boo).

After the codes have been saved, delete all codes for the temporary
game name (granturismo2-temp) from the GameShark, using the triangle
key while viewing the game list with that name highlighted. Then,
rename the permanant game name (in our example granturismo2) to the
temporary name once again (granturismo2-temp) (by editing that name in
one of its codes). Use the menu obtained by the select key to load
codes, and you will load the renamed codes you are cloning; they will
be merged in with the previously existing one.

Finally, rename the game back to its permanent name (granturismo2) and
you are done!

You can then go and edit the cloned code to do something slightly
different while still keeping the old one!  8-)


Bad News:


I vaguely remember reading that a GameShark can get flakey if you have
too many codes for one game, even if most of them are inactive.

I wondered if this was why every now and then zeroes seem to get copied
to the prize car locations instead of the desired values.  That is I
wondered if this could be because I have too many codes (even though
inactive) for the one game.  Although last night I did split the codes
up according to game version, I haven't yet tried to see whether
appears to have helped.

The more I think about it, the more I think that the non-deterministic
timing problems I observed occur because my active code itself is
basically too long--either in terms of number of instructions, or in
terms of number of memory fetches and writes performed, or a
combination of both.  8-(

It makes sense that that could happen, while my other hypothesis does
not make a lot of sense.
