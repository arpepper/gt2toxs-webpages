I Use LSD in Gran Turismo 2, and Maybe I am a Dope!

Well, last night I tried the Gran Turismo World Series with the Arta
Zexel Skyline, a prize from the GT500 Series.  If you want to see
how my garage progresses, you can look <html><a href="logs">here</a></html>.

For instance,
<html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/garage?garage=gt2-game1&simday=jan+14">here</a></html>
is my main <html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/garage?garage=gt2-game1&simday=jan+14">garage</a></html>
up to but not including January 14th, 2000. And
<html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/garage?garage=gt2-game1&simday=">here</a></html>
it is, as up-to-date as it gets.

The first race was Trial Mountain.  The best AI car seemed to be the
dreaded Oreca Viper.  I didn't seem to be able to go as fast as I
expected with the Skyline--I just couldn't get traction, e.g. during
the initial esses, nor throughout the GT1 "A-4" section.  But I worked
my way up to second, and, as often happens, the Viper slowed down for
the very last corner.  I slipped by its side, but then lost control and
hit the wall.  I was lucky to finish third, but so frustrated, and
afraid the Oreca Viper would dominate the series, that I reset the game
and started the series over again without saving the loss.

The second time through, the best AI car was (generally) a GT40.  I
spent some time tuning my car, reducing the spring rate, and tweaking
the front and rear LSD (limited-slip differentials), and did seem to
make it go a bit faster.  In general, I find you want the limited
slip "initial" setting higher than the default.  But still I did not
seem to go as fast as I thought I should, and it was a bit of a
struggle to win the race.

Laguna Seca was a washout.  I never really could catch the first three
cars, and the Lotus Elise squeaked by me on the last corner.

Apricot Hill was a walkover for me, of course.  As a human you can
take a short-cut through the esses near the end that saves you about
two seconds a lap.  The AI cars cut it fairly aggressively, but not
as aggressively as you can, and seem to slow down more than they ought
to even for the line they do take.

Then came the dreaded Long Course at Rome.  I tested and tested, but
could not quite reliably break 1:20.  Then I realized something.  Yes,
indeed I had been running on "normal" tires.  I switched to super-soft
and went somewhat faster.  (Though not startling so).  It was enough
to lead the race from start-to-finish, though.  I even relaxed at the
end, my lap time going up by 2 seconds, and still won by 2.890 seconds.

When I started the series the second time, I had noticed that I was
not using maximum aero at Trial Mountain.  That should have clued
me in.  I now realize I mistakenly thought I had raced this car before
because I had raced the white "Zexel" Skyline, but not this mostly red
"Arta Zexel" Skyline.

Anyway, on with the report.

Midfield is a funny track.  Basically easy to beat the AI cars at, but
with two tricky spots where you can blow it.  The first bad spot is the
180 after the first tunnel.  It's very bumpy and can exacerbate any
understeering or oversteering tendencies a car may have.  It's a lot
easier in a four-wheel-drive car, however.  The second tricky spot
is the sharp left-hander going into the second tunnel, together with
the eeses preceding it.  Oh well, the race seemed easy and I must have
won by a good few seconds.

Once again I was ceremoniously presented with that gold trophy!  And
then, when I went to check my garage, there, finally, after my sixth
win in the series, was the funny-looking, yet powerful, and
powerful-looking 1998 Toyota GT-ONE.  With the red and white (or
is it white and red?) colour scheme it looks to me like a squished
eyeball.  It also looks somewhat like a cockroach, somehow.
