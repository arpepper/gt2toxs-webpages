The following will make an arbitrary car appear in slot 1 of the Toyota
Used Car Lot on days 1 to 9 (and 600 to 609):
<HTML INDENT>

?? should be one of the garage codes as I list in <a href="2000-12-05.html">2000-12-05.html</a>.
Perhaps read some of my words of advice there, too.

The code overwrites the car normally available in that slot of that used car
lot (an MA70 Supra), making it unavailable.  The chosen car is available
instead, for the same low price.  8-)

Do not use the codes for the Corvette'67 (B0), or the hidden DelSols (6A,6B) or Eunos Roadsters (AF),
or the game will lock up.

If you use the codes for the special models the slot disappears
entirely.  (So you cannot buy the special models this way, although [R]
prize cars are fine).

Here's a long version of the codes to create an interesting used car
lineup for the first nine days of the game.  The first five cars
appear in the Toyota lot, and the rest in the Nissan lot.  (These
overwrite the cars normally available there).

The cars I show are in a sense just examples, although I did test the
actual literal examples above.  You can change the car codes
to any valid garage values you want, subject to the same caveats as mentioned
above.

Note that for the cars with colours shown in parentheses I use an <b>80</b>
code instead of a <b>30</b>, and specify the colour byte, to change it
from the often boring default colour for that particular car.

Another thing you could do is change the price associated with each car.
For example:
</CODES>
<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
D00C4510  60A8
800C4518  0001
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>
would make the price of the first car 10 Credits.

<CODES>
Many thanks to all the people who enabled me to create this code,
especially <b>RaysurX</b> who determined the garage codes originally.

Not to mention those who helped me even conceive of the idea of
putting cars into the used car lots.
