(GT2)  GameShark Code to Set Up Two Player Drag Racing in Arcade Mode

Threads:

 Game Shark Hints


Here is a code, for North American Gran Turismo 2, (Arcade Mode)

I have a version for each of the two versions of that disk that
I know of.

It arranges that whenever you attempt to enter any race
which is one lap long, the race gets hijacked to the Max Speed Test
course for a 1000m "drag race".

The Max Speed Test track has the property that the start line is
1000m away from the finish line.  So, if you start on lap 1 of a
lap 1 race, you will be done as soon as you cross the finish line,
but that finish line is actually a full 1000m away.  (Setting the
number of laps to zero does not work, because the game treats that
as a "free session").

Unfortunately, the cars are not lined up evenly for the start.

Here is the code for Version 1.0, the Arcade Mode Disk I got
on the first date of issue of the North American version.  It
requires a GameShark 3.XX, and will interfer with other codes
and so is best used as the only active code.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C01D52CA 0100 -- Does no codes unless race is one lap long
 801D52FC 23D2 -- sets track to Max Speed Test
 801D52FE 74C8 -- sets track, part two

 D00A99AC 0000 -- tests if player 1 lap count is zero
 800A99AC 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
 D00AA4EC 0000 -- tests if player 2 lap count is zero
 800AA4EC 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

Notes:
C01D52CA 0100 -- Does no codes unless race is one lap long
The first "global condition" can be set to anything you think is
appropriate.

While you should be able to play most of the game with these codes on,
I wouldn't guarantee it, and it makes most sense to me to activate the
codes, play some drag races, and never save the game with the codes in
effect.  Don't bother saving any replays; they're liable to screw up,
unless you view them with this code in effect.

The addresses used for this version of the disk are, by semi-coincidence,
the same as those for the 1.0 version of the Simulation Disk.

If your GameShark does not support C0, but does support D0, (version
2.XX, not version 3.XX) you can put

D01D52CA 0100

(Ie. Does next code only if track race is one lap long)

in front of the two track setting codes.  Unfortunately, in that case
all Arcade Mode races will start with a one lap head start for two of
the cars.

I.e.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 D01D52CA 0100 -- Tests whether race is one lap long
 801D52FC 23D2 ---- if so, sets track to Max Speed Test
 D01D52CA 0100 -- Tests whether race is one lap long
 801D52FE 74C8 ---- if so,  sets track, part two

 D00A99AC 0000 -- tests if player 1 lap count is zero
 800A99AC 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
 D00AA4EC 0000 -- tests if player 2 lap count is zero
 800AA4EC 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

All the usual cautions with GameShark Codes apply in this case.

Here are the corresponding codes for the other version of the Arcade
Mode disk.  I got this version with both other copies of Gran Turismo
2 I bought.  The version of the Simulation Mode Disk you got does not
guarantee which version of the Arcade Mode Disk you will have got.

For GameShark 3.XX:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 C01D563A 0100 -- Does no codes unless race is one lap long
 801D566C 23D2 -- sets track to Max Speed Test
 801D566E 74C8 -- sets track, part two

 D00A9A5C 0000 -- tests if player 1 lap count is zero
 800A9A5C 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
 D00AA59C 0000 -- tests if player 2 lap count is zero
 800AA59C 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

For GameShark 2.XX:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 D01D563A 0100 -- Tests whether race is one lap long
 801D566C 23D2 ---- if so, sets track to Max Speed Test
 D01D563A 0100 -- Tests whether race is one lap long
 801D566E 74C8 ---- if so,  sets track, part two

 D00A9A5C 0000 -- tests if player 1 lap count is zero
 800A9A5C 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
 D00AA59C 0000 -- tests if player 2 lap count is zero
 800AA59C 0001 ---- if so, sets it to 1
