Nismo 400R Does Reasonably Well in SSR11 All-Night I in Nismo Game

I decided to go back to my old <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html>
<html><a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/nismo">nismo</a></html> game.
In this game I had been using the Nismo 400R as much as possible, so I
entered the race-mod version in the All-night I Event, and did a
reasonably fast time.  I was surprised, actually, that playing
<html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font> actually seems to have improved
my <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html> skills.

I led from start to finish again, in a fairly uneventful race, lapping
the field by my first pit stop.

This was only about a ten seconds slower than the Cerbera LM, and I
lapped the field three times.

I won Cr150,000, and the green Silvia LM.   8-)  The green one looks
so much nicer than the red one.   8-)

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...
