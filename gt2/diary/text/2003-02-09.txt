In the <a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/gt1-mazda">mazda</a> game
(Maybe <a href="../logs/gt1-mazda.txt">here</a>),
I used the 1991 FD RX7 Type R for many races.
So I decided to enter the race-modified version in
the Grand Valley 300.

I dropped to second behind the Impreza for a while, but regained the
lead early on the first lap, before the second hairpin,
and then pulled steadily away into a commanding lead.

I never dropped out of first during my pit stops.

Although I must have passed the GT-R earlier, I finally saw it towards
the end, when I must have been lapping it for at least the third time.

I had a nasty time-consuming mishap on lap 47 when I snagged myself
on the inside of the double hairpin at the end of the track.

This result was almost identical to the time I set the last time I
used the Mazda special model RX-7 LM.  Almost identical, as in
only 20.3 seconds faster!

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 60 lap times...

Actual total count, at 800BDB74, was 00578E68, or 5738088 thousandths
of seconds.  So the above is exactly right.

The settings are quite moderate, to try and avoid the infamous
handling quirks of this series of RX-7's in Gran Turismo.
