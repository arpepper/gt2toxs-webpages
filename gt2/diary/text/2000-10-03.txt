More Impressions of Sports Car GT

Well, last night I played Sports Car GT some more, and managed to open
up the GT2 level.

It turns out you that if you have already opened up GT3, and do well
enough in GTQ again, you get a chance to enter a special race for
a $10,000 fee.  I did that twice last night.  The first time I
won a team BMW.

That car was relatively easy to place in the top three of all races
of GT3.  Hey!  I even came first at good old Laguna Seca!  Although
the track is different in some fine details, practice in the

The Corkscrew in Sports Car GT is definitely not the stomach-curdling
experience that it is in
<html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html>, however!

So that opened up GT2 level.  I then went back, did well in GTQ again,
and won a team Porsche.  It was then well-and-truly time for bed.

I sort of assume that what one does now is race the GT3 again, and
thereby win a good car for the GT2 level.  I'm also beginning to
accumulate a moderately large amount of money--about $150,000.

It seems odd to me that so many games leave details of the true method of
playing them as secrets.

For instance, if I ever find the secret to allow me to tune a car
between races in a series, I'll be sure to let you know.  Whenever
I try it, it seems to cause me to restart the whole series.
