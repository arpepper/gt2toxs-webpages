A Comparison of Speed 12 Settings

I still say I'm not a great tuner (nor am I a tuner that tastes great)
but, I think these Speed 12 settings indicate something fairly fundamental.

Okay, with the default settings, you spin out all over the place.
With mine you don't.
In fact, you almost have trouble holding it in on some of the corners.
That is understeer.  It allows you to acclerate even on the bumpy
bankings without spinning around.

The fundamental change I made compared to the default settings was to
soften the front suspension.
So I claim, contrary to what many tuning guides say,
that softening the front suspension causes more understeer, and stiffening
it causes more oversteer.  And conversely for the rear suspension.

Note, however, that stiffer front stabilizers will cause understeer.
That is because they actually provoke the front into sliding sooner.
(Force which would otherwise cause the body to roll instead causes the
inside wheel to lift).
