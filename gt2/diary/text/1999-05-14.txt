Sort of a rest day, with discoveries of Improved Skill

  Used Car Information

Wedmesday, I spent most of my time looking at OPM 31 disk.  Not much
there.  I seemed to be a little better at the Ridge Racer Type 4
Demo than I had been before.

On Thursday, I still got home too late to do another Grand Valley 300KM,
so I did two UKvsJP and then some time trials.

I got a few inconsequential P.B.'s in the UKvsJP; I think I would
have got an albrnick fastest lap record, but someone posted at
1:06.xxx at SSR5 in the meantime, beating my 1:07.780

In between the two sessions of UKvsJP, I set a new SSR11 Time
Trial, beating the ConceptCar (admittedly from a while ago).

   SSR11   Time Trials
   [R]GTO'95 MR       1:44.263  +  1:40.140rec  =  3:24.403rec

I surprised myself in the time trials.  Using the Cerbera, even not
being used to it, I did much better than the records it held (set
on Januwary 31).  At SSR5ii, I set a new fastest total by almost
five seconds, including a fastest lap by two seconds, even though
I spun out completely on the second lap!  So I went back and took
yet another six seconds and more off.

This was all before I let the [R]GTO'95 MR demolish it.  8-(
By yet another six seconds.

   SSR5ii  Time Trials
   [R]Cerbera LM      1:20.222  +  1:16.222rec  =  2:36.444rec
   [R]Cerbera LM      1:17.590  +  1:12.344rec  =  2:29.934rec
   [R]GTO'95 MR       1:14.045  +  1:09.139rec  =  2:23.184rec

The [R]GTO'95 MR also did well at GVEii and GV time trials, although
it could not come very close to the ConceptCar.  It did, however,
beat the ConceptCar record for SSR11, by about ten seconds, I think.
(I forgot to note it).

I should have gone to bed, but instead I did a bit of Arcade Mode.
After some practice, I found it possible to win using a Cerbera
at Grand Valley leading from start to finish.  (Admittedly, this
was in a field without a Stingray).  I set some records that way,
but did not bother to keep them.
