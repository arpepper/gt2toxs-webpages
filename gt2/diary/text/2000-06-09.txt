 License Test Progress

Well, it was generally much easier to get all golds on my B license tests
in <html><font color="blue" size="+1">G</font><font color="red" size="+1">T</font><font color="silver" size="+1">2</font></html> than
it had been
in <html><font color="blue" size="+1">G</font><font color="red" size="+1">T</font><font color="black" size="+1">1</font></html>.

It took me only three days once I put my mind to it.
Here are my progress notes from my <html><a href="logs/gt2-game1">game log</a>.

Note that in order to pass B-4 (the small circle pad with the
econobox) I had to use digital throttle/brake instead of my
usual analog.  This leads me to wonder quite strongly whether
the analog throttle is incapable of getting up to 100%.

The Spoon S2000 is, as everyone says, a nice car.  8-)  I won a yellow
one.
