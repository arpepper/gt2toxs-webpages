(GT2 Version 1.0) Brief Memory Map for GameShark Use

Here is a brief memory map of locations I found by inspecting the
simulation mode disk from my original copy of Gran Turismo 2.

This version shows 3 different licenses above the Muscle Car Cup on the page
under Special Events, although the actual requirements are IA for all
races.

This version spells "Nomal" incorrectly for the Event Generator,
and shows a Cr5,000 car wash.
This version has the garage delete bug.

801C9438 - A. day counter (as you see in bottom-left corner),4b,273
801C9440 - B. total races,4b,285
801C9444 - C. total wins,4b,230
801C9448 - D. total "positions" or "rankings",4b,403
801C944C - E. total races not including abandons(?),4b,285
     D/E does appear to equal "average ranking"
801C9454 - total prize money,4b

Following this appears to be various "nybble maps" probably
representing license status, plus various records, probably
license and maybe Time Trials, ending with the dreaded
Machine Test records, including the most deadly Max Speed
records.

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801CCF10 - # of max speed records
801CCF14 - 8 max speed records, 20 bytes each
              car(4b),speed*100(4b),name(12b)
         - problem is, sometimes the game thinks there's room for 10  :)

801CCFB4 - garage count (number of cars)
801CCFB8 - first car of 100 car garage
</pre>
</HTML>

Soon after the end of the garage is...

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801D0FC8 - number of credits in your bank account
801D0FCC - zero-origin index of current car in garage
801D0FCF - last name used for records, e.g.  ARP27Feb01
