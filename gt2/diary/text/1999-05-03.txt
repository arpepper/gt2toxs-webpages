Well, I practised a lot for driving the Viper GTS-R in the Grand Valley
300, but it did not seem to help much.

So, as you can tell from the times, the race was tense.  There have been
other races where the AI car times would have beat this one.

I jumped to an early second, gaining a brief lead after the first
pit exchange.  I had dropped to fourth when pitting, but worked back
to 2nd fairly quickly, and briefly held the lead when the leader
finally pitted.  But he got by me again.  At one point during the
race, the GTO rear-ended me into the gravel, and took off,
gaining several seconds that way.

I had another brief lead from about laps 27 to 30, as I passed the
GTO while it was in the pits, but once again it caught me, just
before my pit stop at lap 36.  However, the GTO pitted soon after
that, and by lap 40 I was in command.  I lost the lead on lap 48,
but regained it on the track before the GTO's final pit stop,
which it finally took at lap 53, so then I almost cruised to
victory.  (This field was relatively weak, with a slowish winning
time).

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

One interesting thing about the Viper GTS-R was that, perhaps because
of its relatively heavy weight, it was quite easy to drive well with
worn tires.  I almost wondered if I should have stretched some of
my runs, but its handling was such that when duelling close up the
slippery tires would probably have been a disadvantage, so I decided
to be cautious.

The next Grand Valley 300 entrant will be the red Honda del Sol LM
Edition.  This seems to be another car which requires a lot of learning
in order to drive well.
