Life Beyond Gran Turismo


If you concentrate on spending less time playing Gran Turismo, you really
can get more done.

Saturday I finally began the process of looking for a new real car, but
that was somewhat discouraging.  Auto makers and dealers seem to be
conspiring to no longer sell the sort of useful small cars that I
like.

Saturday night I decided to go to bed early, having played none since
Friday, and was able to get up at 6:00am.  I got on my bicycle shortly
after 7, and went for a little spin to Fergus and back (about 75km
total) and got some much needed exercise.

The trouble is, Gran Turismo can produce some of the same endorphins
as physically exercise, but without the real benefits.

I got back on Sunday at about 11am, and there was still a lot of the
day left.

Thread: Race Results

I decided to drive the NSX-R LM GT2 (Honda special model) some more.
I won the GT-I Cup with it, but with a little help from the best AI
car which showed up--a Nismo GT-R LM; it placed first of the AI
in all races except the last, where it dropped back a further
place.  Now, I only won three races, so if that had not happened,
we would have tied, but instead I won 45 to 43.

I've definitely got the NSX-R LM GT2 in better form than when I lost
the Grand Valley 300 with it, but it's still sort of weird.  It's
the only car with which I have a difficult time winning at the
High Speed Ring, and that really gets the GT-I Cup off to a bad
start.  I won Trial Mountain, but went off on the first hairpin
on the last lap of Grand Valley and had to settle for second.
I won SSR5, but was glad to manage second at the dreaded Deep
Forest.  SSR11 was a relatively easy win.
