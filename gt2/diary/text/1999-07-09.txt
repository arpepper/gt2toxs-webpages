My GTO Settings

  Used Car Information

Just in case anyone is interested I, FWIW, dug out my current GTO
settings.  I'm not a great tuner (nor am I a tuner that tastes great)
but, well here's what I've been using lately.

The first three cars are from my "real" game, while the last is from my
current attempt to quickly collect all race prize cars.  (Which did not
go as quickly as I expected, but is finally down the backstretch at 998
days, with only 2Mega,2 4wd, 1GV300, 1All-NightI car to go).

As far as I can tell, in Gran Turismo, both high stabilizers and low
ride height increase your tendency to slide (or at least, to slide
before visibly rolling).  Assuming that is true, it's presumably
because the physics model in that case dissipates the force as slide
rather than roll.  Roll should cause a slide eventually, but it seems
to be noticeably delayed if the car does roll.  And/or it is a lot
easier to "read" a rolling car than a sliding one on the screen,
especially on slow tracks.  (E.g.  Autumn Ring).  (The "never turning
over" algorithm must come into effect here somewhere, too).

[1] while idly running a 0-400 test (as the way to find the settings)
I set a personal best.  But it wasn't a very good time, so I won't tell
you that it was 8.554 seconds.

[2]This is tuned the way it was when it managed to lap the Civic in
the last race (SSR11ii) in the Tuned series.  I had used stabilizers
of 5F/4R for HSRii,GVii, and CR5ii.  For ARii it would use 3/3 stabilizers,
and turbo spec 3; I might have used "normal" (no) intercooler, but I
can't remember for sure (and don't have specific notes).

As a last remark, however fast I manage to get with a GTO'95MR, an
R32SkylineGT-R'89 does seem to end up being faster...
