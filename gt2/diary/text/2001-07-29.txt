A "Proper" Game Using Nissans As Much As Possible

I finished the <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> 
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/proper">proper</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/proper.txt">here</a>) but wanted to continue
playing
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>.

So I decided once again to complete
simulation mode
doing all the races in proper license order without entering any race
twice, but this time I decided to Nissans as much as possible.
In particular, I decided to use the 1988 Nissan S13Silvia 1800c K's
as much as possible.

The log of that game is 
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/nissan">here</a>
(maybe <a href="../logs/nissan.txt">here</a>).

Note that Nissan does not have any offerings allowed to enter the
<b>LightWeight Cup</b>.

But previous tests had indicated to me that, with a little preparation,
I could win the <b>Normal</b> series with the <b>1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R</b>.
With just light modifications, too, (soft slicks and turbo-spec 2) the
same car can win the tough <b>4WD</b> series.  Actually, it can win
with somewhat cheaper modifications (especially tires), but using soft
slicks makes them available to you later in the game, without having
to waste the cost of cheaper tires.
