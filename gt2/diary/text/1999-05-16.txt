This time I ran the [R]GTO'95 MR with racing intercooler, and semi-racing
exhaust, instead of normal intercooler.

So, I led from start to finish again.  The first two cars were lapped by
lap eight, and the third by lap 10, the field by lap 14; some cars
were lapped for the second time by lap 16.

A little eye irritation slowed me slightly after lap 20, but went
away after a couple of laps.

You can see this was an absurdly slow field.  In fact, the more I
try and remember the details, the more I think I must have done
this race *after* racing the tuned GTO'95 MR.  At times it's like
the game responds to the calibre of your previous entrant.

I believe I used the tuned car as a model to help with gear settings
suitable for use with heavier turbocharging.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

I was pleased that I took another 30 seconds off my time with this car.
