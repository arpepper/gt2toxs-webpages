I finally win a second "real" gold medal (for B-4)

Threads:
  License Test Progress

Well, a little (a lot actually) persistence paid off again.  I got my
second "real" gold license test medal (B-4) (B-1,B-2 and A-7 do not
count as "real" gold, but I got B-7 earlier).  Interestingly the car is
the same, a Nissan Silvia, in both B-7 and B-4.

The run was rather hairy.  I chopped so much off the apex of the turn ,
and my wheels were so solidly on the grass that I thought I'd probably
be disqualified, but lose too much time even if I wasn't.  And in the
replay my line looks rather U-shaped as opposed to the ideal parabola.

As seemed to happen a couple of times before, I got gold after almost
resigning myself to not meeting the goal that evening--I sort of relaxed
a bit.  I'd done 24.811 early in the evening (gold is 24.800), and
sort of surprised myself with my 24.784--a "golder" gold than my first
one which was only .005 seconds under.
