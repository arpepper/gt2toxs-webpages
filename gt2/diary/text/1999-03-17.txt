Another Level of Crash Bandicoot 3

Threads:

  Crash Bandicoot

Monday and Tuesday night I redid FR Series and UKvsJP with a Cerbera
LM.  With that car I can leave the UKvsJP competitors behind, and can
leave the FR Series waaay behind,

Earlier Tuesday evening my nephew was over with his CD and memory card
for Crash Bandicoot 3.  Turns out there was another motorcycle racing
level he and his mother wanted me to try.  This one was harder; it took
me five or six tries to complete, maybe even more.
