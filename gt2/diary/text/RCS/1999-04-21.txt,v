The Special NSX is not good, but the Special RX-7 seems excellent

Well, my slight misgivings about the Honda/Acura NSX-R LM GT2, the
Cr500,000 model offered by Honda/Acura turned into fully realized
fears.  In early practice for the Grand Valley 300, I realized
that the suspension was just too harshly tuned for the twisty,
occasionally bumpy, track.  Perhaps a good driver could get very
good times, but I found the problem was that if you hit a minor
obstacle, recovering from rebound action meant you suffered several
seconds.

I did soften the suspension considerably, and this made the car quite
driveable, but I could not overcome its poor power to weight ratio.
Testing was so difficult I never did get in my usual twelve lap run to
verify tire wear; only during the race did I discover that this car
seems to need five pitstops, not just four.  (Strategy note: if you
think a car will last eleven laps, but definitely not twelve, then come
in at ten laps anyway.  Pit stops every eleven costs you the same time
as pit stops every ten, plus the extra time lost driving on the worse
tires).

Anyway, driving this car in this event left me with no good
impressions.  So here are the gorey details.

I had a lot of minor disasters.   I got Cr50,000 for fifth place.

Time was 1-44:20.6; at least this was more than two minutes better than
I had managed with the Eclipse.  Note that the game still contrived to
make me finish fifth, not fourth.  Of course, one could legitimately
interpret this as a slightly stronger field than the Eclipse had
faced.

Oh well.  The next contender should fare better.  It is the Mazda
special model RX7 LM.  I was surprised how well it did in UKvsJP,
with little practice.

This won the series, 45 to 28, and won a Cerbera  8-(.  Green, of course.  8-(

Clearly this RX7 can always give a Cerbera LM a good run for its
money, and occasionally, if not frequently, beat it.
