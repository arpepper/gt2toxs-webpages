Grant Tomaso, a Gran Turismo Legend in his own Time^H^H^H^HMind...

In the directory <html><a href="logs">logs</a></html> I keep several logs of
some of my interesting games; the directory now has a sort of
interesting form on it that lets you find out what the garage
for each game looked like on different days.

The most recent game I have completed is the <html><a href="logs/gold">gold</a></html>
game in which I won all the gold race cups in 100 days of simulation
mode.
I also posted to the newsgroup rec.games.video.sony a fictionalized
version of that game, as follows:

It seemed as if Grant Tomaso had appeared from nowhere.  Nobody had
seen him racing anywhere, not even in low-level Spot events, but he
just started passing all his B license tests, taking a single attempt
for each.  Rumours were he made a special deal with the licensing
officials, and actually took two tests in a single day when passing his
final test.

He similarly flew through his A license tests, one day each, but the
rumours were even louder then.  If he was that good, why did he not get
a single non-bronze time?  (except for A7, a low-speed doughnut test,
generally regarded by experts as having time limits which are too
easy).

The day after acquiring his A license, Grant showed up at the Sunday
Cup event in a stock 1993 Honda Civic 3door si, Captiva blue pearl
in colour, apparently purchased for Cr8,870--nearly exhausting his
his limited financial resources.  He opened eyes by capturing the pole
for his first race at the Autumn Ring Mini, and won all three races in
the Series, although he qualified only 6th at the High Speed Ring, and
4th at Grand Valley East.  This accomplishment impressed Mazda Racing
so much they offered him a chance to race for them in a Demio Aspec,
but Grant left his options open at that point.

Next he showed up at the Clubman Cup series, having apparently modified
his car slightly.<html><a name="refer1" href="#note1">[1]</a></html>  He won this event, winning two races, from sixth
grid position in each case.  He came 3rd in the Clubman race itself, as
two of his opponents capitalized on slight mistake the second time
through the sharp corner.  Once again he left his options open after
receiving an offer to drive a Camaro for Chevrolet--clearly he had
better things in mind.

He had apparently bought and fitted some more parts when he showed up
in the same car for the Front-Wheel Drive Challenge.<html><a name="refer2" href="#note2">[2]</a></html>  However,
experts speculated he was saving some of his resources for something
bigger.  Nevertheless, Grant won this series cleanly, winning all three
races, and qualifying 4th at Grand Valley East, and 1st at Special
Stage Route 11.  He was not willing at the point to drive a
factory-provided yellow Honda CRX.

Speculation mounted when he made only slight additional modifications
before showing up for the LightWeight Battle Stage in the same car.<html><a name="refer3" href="#note3">[3]</a></html>
Grant won this event too, but not without a little luck.  After
capturing the pole for the Autumn Ring Mini ii, and winning that
race and the Clubman (qualifying 4th), he suffered the second loss
of his career, coming only 4th at Deep Forest Racing Way after
qualifying 5th.  However, this was good enough to win the series
21 to 19.  Honda tried again to sign him up, but he did not think
the blue Civic racer model was a good deal, but again left the option
open.

Yes, he had been saving up for something.  Grant Tomaso showed up next
at the Normal Car World Speed Contest, in a shiny new red Dodge Viper
RT/10<html><a name="refer4" href="#note4">[4]</a></html>.  He totally dominated this series, and won the maximum
possible Cr400,000.  This time he caught the attention of Subaru, but
left the orange Impreza as an open option.  At this point he was all
set to dominate Gran Turismo Racing.

Remaining independent for a while longer, he bought another used car--a
passion red 1995 Mitsubishi GTOMR, and modified it to the max.<html><a name="refer5" href="#note5">[5]</a></html>  He
was lucky to have found this car; for weeks following his purchase they
became impossible to find, in any colour.

At this point Grant took a break from racing to obtain his International
A License.  He did this in the minimal 8 days, but, once again, there
was speculation he had special deals with the licensing authority to
allow him to try twice in a day.

Grant next showed up at the 4WD Challenge series, making mincemeat of the
opposition and sweeping all poles and winning all races.  As before, he
tabled an opportunity to drive a green Lancer provided by Mitsubishi.

Then, to everyone's shock, he entered the Special Stage Route 11
All-Night I Event with his GTO'95MR--even though he had not modified
it for racing.  He ran away with this event, and rumours were he
would finally take a professional ride and drive a red Silvia LM for
Nissan in some future event.  However, for the time being he racked
up wins in his tuned GTO'95MR, sweeping poles and races in each of
the Mega Speed Event, the GT Cup, and surprisingly the international
US - Japan Sports Car Championship--once again beating racing-spec
cars in a car without racing modification.  Team offers from Aston
Martin, Toyota, and Dodge were all left open but not accepted.

Everyone eagerly watched as he dominated the Hard-Tuned Car Speed
Contest, winning all poles and all races in this five-race series, even
the race at the tricky Autumn Ring ii.  At the relatively short Special
Stage R11 race he even lapped one of the other cars!  Nissan offered
him a red 1991 Skyline for that achievement, but he did not drive that
car, although he did drive a factory-supplied Nissan in his next race.

He showed up with a red Nissan Silvia LM racing machine for the Grand
Valley 300km Endurance Race.  He won the pole (just) and ran away with
the race, beating the Honda/Acura NSX-R LM GT2 by over two laps,
clawing his way back from a fairly bad start and a disastrous second
lap.

He seriously considered an offer to drive a black Castrol Supra GT in
the Anglo-Japanese Sports Car Championship, but elected instead to
drive the same red Silvia LM for Nissan.  Once again he ran away with
all poles and races.  Impressed by this, Honda offered him a chance to
drive a red delSol LM, but, after so much success it almost looked like
Grant was preparing to retire--people began noticing he never entered
the same event twice.  There were only a few events he had not won in
Grand Turismo racing.

He took up on old offer from Dodge, and won the Anglo-American Sports
Car Championship in a white Viper GTS-R with blue stripes.  Although he
won all five poles, he won only four races, as a couple of mistakes
caused him to come second at the Special Stage Route 11 Event to a very
nimble TVR Griffiths 500.

Dodge still found that performance impressive, however, and Grant next
accepted a very interesting offer from that company, as he raced the GT
World Cup in their purple Concept Car.  This car was so good, the
series was hardly challenging at all, but some records, such as a
three-lap Grand Valley Race under 4:30, made him quite happy as he won
all six poles and all six races.  Winning this series earned him the
coveted right to set night-time time trial records at various tracks.

He had won a lot.  What was there left?  Well, he took his old 
1995 Mitsubishi GTO MR to the Special Stage All-Night II Event,
and dominated that, winning the pole and the winning the race in
under 52 minutes, lapping the field three times.

And then someone observed that the only series he had never entered was
the Rear-Wheel Drive Challenge.  So, he entered that with his old Dodge
Viper RT/10--without making any modifications from stock.  He captured
the pole at the first race, at Grand Valley East ii, but people were
somewhat disappointed when he only qualified 2nd at both the Deep
Forest Racing Way and Grand Valley ii events.  However, he did win the
series by winning all three races.  Nissan offered him a chance to
drive a yellow S13 Silvia Q's, but he turned it down.

Not only that, but, as quickly as he had appeared on the scene, Grant
Tomaso vanished from the Grand Turismo racing scene.  Just 100 days
after he had first appeared, he retired with a small fortune in cash<html><a name="refer6" href="#note6">[6]</a></html>
and a garage full of cars<html><a name="refer7" href="#note7">[7]</a></html> to a lead a safe and tranquil life.
