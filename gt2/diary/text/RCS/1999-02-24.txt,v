Impressions of the prize Supra RZ when maxed.

Threads:
  Prize Car Information

Well, today I made a Cr20000 copy of the prize Supra RZ using the
memory card trade, and maxed it.  I'm not impressed.  It is a real
handful to handle and I can't even get it to break 10 seconds in the
400m.  Though I did set a new max speed record of 255mph, albeit using
my usual wrong-way technique.  I swept the Clubman Cup with it, but
that doesn't prove much.  It was fairly far from record times in all
cases.
