A Relatively Complete List of GameShark Code Meanings

PlayStation Action Replay 3,
GameShark 3 and GameBuster 3


The code types listed here apparently work for
Action Replay (English, Japanese, French),
GameShark and Game Buster version 3 cartridges.
They are also supposed to work for some slightly earlier
versions, namely GameSharks 2.41 and above,
UK Action Replay, German GameBuster and French
Action Replay 2.8 and above,  and Japanese Action
Replay 2.5 and above.

80
Store word.  This s the most commonly used code. It simply repeatedly writes the
given 16 bit value to the given memory location.

Example: Cause the 16-bit hex value 55A2 to be repeatedly written to
memory location 10D102.

8010D102 55A2

Byte 10D102 receives the value A2, while the next byte location,
10D103, receives 55.

30
Store byte. Like 80 code but affects only the byte
at the given address, which address may be odd or even.

Example: The byte value 2C is repeatedly written to
the memory location 10D507

3010D507 002C

Conditional Codes

These codes allow you to do codes only when certain conditions,
determined by examining memory locations, are met.
These code helps prevent memory values from being changed when doing
so would cause disaster.  By checking for a value which you know
corresponds to a certain place in the game, you can usually avoid
the code having adverse effects.

D0
If word value in the supplied location is the same as the supplied value
do the next code, otherwise skip it.

Example: If the 16-bit memory location 1C353 has the
value D5D8 then do the code 801D156A  05F3, otherwise
skip to the code which follows it.

D01C353C  D5D8
801D156A  05F3


D1
If the word (16-bit) value in the supplied location is different from the
supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


D2
If the word (16-bit) value in the supplied location is less than the
supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


D3
If the word (16-bit) value in the supplied location is greater than the
supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


E0
If byte value in the supplied location is the same as the supplied value
do the next code, otherwise skip it.


E1
If byte value in the supplied location is different from
the supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


E2
If byte value in the supplied location is less than
the supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


E3
If byte value in the supplied location is greater than
the supplied value do the next code, otherwise skip it.


Increment (add to) and Decrement (subtract from) Codes

10
Increment (add to) word (16-bit) code.   Only use this code conditionally,
i.e after a DX or EX code.   It adds the value supplied to the
16-bit value at the location.  Note this is done repeatedly, and so it,
and all the other increment/decrement codes, are difficult to make useful.

Example: Add 7 to word location 001FF0 when
word location 001FF0 is equal less than 000D

        D2001FF0 000D
        10001FF0 0007


11
Decrement (subtract from) word code.  Only use this code conditionally,
i.e after a DX or EX code.   It subtracts the value supplied from the
16-bit value at the location.

Example: Subtract 7 from word location 001FF0 when
word location 001FF0 is greater than  00B0

        D3001FF0 00B0
        11001FF0 0007


20
Increment (add to) byte (8-bit) code.  Only use this code conditionally,
i.e after a DX or EX code.   It adds the value supplied to the
8-bit value at the location.

Example: Add 7 to byte location 001FF0 when
word location 001FF0 is less than 000D

        D2001FF0 000D
        20001FF0 0007

21
Decrement (subtract from) byte (8-bit) code.  Only use this code
conditionally, i.e after a DX or EX code.   It subtracts the value
supplied from the 8-bit value at the location.

Example: Subtract 5 from the byte location 80001231
when byte location 80001230 is greater than 0006

        E3001231 0006
        21001231 0005



50
Serial code.  You can use with 80/30 codes to avoid lots
of repetitions of similar codes if you wish to update large
numbers of consecutive memory locations.

The 50 code itself must precede a normal store code.
This contains the number of repeats and
the size of the code to write (1 for byte, 2 for words). You can also
specify a value to increase by on each repeat.

5000RR0S 0000     ;RR is the number of repeats
                  ;S is the size. 2 for words, 1 for
bytes (use 2 with 80 codes and 1 with 30 codes). This
value is added to the code address each repeat. So if
the code after the 5 code was an 80000000 and this
value was 2 - each loop the address would be
80000000, then 80000002, then 80000004, etc. If this S
value was 4 the addresses would be 80000000, then
80000004, then 80000008, etc. Note that with 80000000
codes this S value must be even (2,4,6,8,A,C), with
30000000 codes which work on bytes this S value can
be any number from 1 to F.

50000000 IIII     ; IIII is the value to increase the
written value by (optional).

eg. 50000502 0000
801CCFBC 1111

is equivalent to

801CCFBC 1111
801CCFBE 1111
801CCFC0 1111
801CCFC2 1111
801CCFC4 1111


eg. 50000502 0001
801CCFBC 0001

is equivalent to

801CCFBC 0001
801CCFBE 0002
801CCFC0 0003
801CCFC2 0004
801CCFC4 0005




New Code Types


Several additional conditional codes were made available
in all versions 3.x.  They are also available in newer version 2
software (US 2.41+, UK 2.8+, JAP 2.5+).


Must Be On / Master Codes
If a code name starts with the text "(M)" or "(m)" then
that code is always on.

The user cannot switch it off if they select the codes
for that game.   See the codes for "Gran Turismo" for an example. This
has a Must Be On code that disables the JoyPad toggle feature. If the
JoyPad toggle is not disabled for this game - it won't load (note that
this is so far the only game that requires this).


D4    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00).

Joypad D code. if joypad press equals word value do
the next code.

Table of JoyPad values
       Up          (1000)
       Right       (2000)
       Down        (4000)
       Left        (8000)
       Triangle          (0010)
       O           (0020)
       X           (0040)
       Square            (0080)
       Select            (0100)
       Start       (0800)

       L1          (0004)
       R1          (0008)
       L2          (0001)
       R2          (0002)
Add combinations. E.g. Select+R1 == 0100+0008 == 0108

For example, the code "801CCFBB DE31" will be on
when the user presses
Select and Square at the same time:
        
        D4000000 0180
        801CCFB8 DE31

Also note: To combine different button presses, simply add the button
values together.  Remember these are in Hex, so Square and X would be
0080+0040 = 00C0.

This does not seem to work with all games.


D5    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00).
All codes on. If joypad press equals word value, all
codes on.

This "turn codes on/off" feature is permanently
available in all games and defaults to
"SELECT+L1+R1" for on and "SELECT+L2+R2" for
off. The D5 and D6 codes are available if you need to
change the buttons used or disable them.

If the value given if zero (D5000000 0000 or D6000000
0000) then joypad functions are disabled (This is the
same as "joypad toggle disabled" in the options screen).
This feature is provided because "Gran Turismo" failed to
load when the joypad features were active.

Example: To make codes turn on when you press
START and X together. The following code should
be used:

        D5000000 0840


D6    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00).
All codes off. if joypad press equals word value, all
codes off.

This does the opposite of the D5 code. See the D5 code
description for details.

Example: To make codes turn off when you press
START and X together. The following code should
be used: (Start = 0800 and X = 0040, 0800+0040=0840).

        D5000000 0840

There are several other interesting extended codes which
are available in more recent GameSharks.


C0    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00).
If word value in location supplied is the same as
value, do ALL codes, otherwise don't do any.

A C0 code if the same as a D0 code except it acts on
ALL codes. This is useful for games that don't load when
codes are on, or if you want to avoid repeating the
same D0 code a lot of times.

For example: If you had a game for which you don't
want any codes on until the memory location
801CCFB8 contains the value C038 you could have
the following code:

        "(M) Must be on"
        C01CCFB8 C038
        
Having the text "(M)" at the start of the name of the
code makes the code default to ON and the user
cannot turn it off in the code list.  It is inadvisable
to have more than one C0 code in the set of active codes.


C1    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00).
Code on delay time. Delay codes being turned on for
a period of time specified by the value part of this
code. By default this value is set to 1388 hex (5000
decimal) which waits about 10 seconds before
activating the cheats. This can be a useful alternative
to a D code for keeping codes off whilst a game loads.

Example: To delay all codes from being turned on for
about 30 seconds in most games use the code
C1000000 4000. The value you use depends on the
game you are playing--the value 4000 might be 30
seconds on one game, but may only be 10 seconds on
another. The only way is to know for sure is to
experiment. You can tell if codes are on or off when by
going in to the "In Game Menu" and looking at the
text "Codes are ON". If it says "Codes are ON" then
codes are on, if it says "Codes are ON." (with a .' at
the end of the string) then codes are actually off until
this timer runs out.
        
You might want to put this code in a code that
can't be turned off (i.e. use the text "(M)" in the
name). The example code then becomes:

        "(M) Must be on"
        C1000000 4000


C2    (No effect in V1.00/V2.00)

Copy bytes code. This code copy's n bytes from a
memory location to another.
The code must be used in pairs of two codes. The
first code is the source address, the second is the
destination address. The value part of the first code is
the number of bytes to copy. The value part of the
second code is not used.

Example: Copy 6 bytes from memory location 80010000 to 80010010.
        C2010000 0006
        10010010 0000
