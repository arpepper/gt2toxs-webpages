  Car Information

Well, yes it is an easy drive to win the Grand Valley 300, and
certainly has adequate speed, etc., but it isn't all that much fun to
drive.  It handles a little like a truck.  A very fast truck, but a
truck.  It's acceleration, while consistent, is always somewhat
gradual.  The car sticks well on corners, but is difficult to provoke
into corrective maneuvers.  On the other hand, because it corners
predictably, corrective measures are not often necessary.
