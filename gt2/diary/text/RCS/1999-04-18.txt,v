Testing My Own Endurance?

Threads:
  All-Night I Results
  Grand Valley 300 Results
  Race Results

Well, after driving that GTO'95 MR, I wanted to make sure I could still
drive the FR Cerbera LM.  I didn't encounter much problem; I wasn't
spinning all over the place, but it did take some getting used to and
I didn't seem to get close to my record times.

A non-record setting sweep of UKvsJP won another red del Sol  8-(.
I want that red and gray Cerbera LM...  I just don't seem to be
able to win it.

Thread: All-Night I Results
Thread: Prize Car Information

Anyway, I decided to try the SSR11 All-Night i with the Cerbera LM,
to try winning with a non-cheat car.  I consider the Concept Car so
good it is essentially a cheat to use it.

Thread: Grand Valley 300 Results

Well, that was a bit of endurance testing, but I wanted more.  So I
took the canonical FTO LM to the GV300.

If I can, I'll get a time (and possibly placing other than 1st 8-) for all
LM prize cars and dealer special models at GV300, and perhaps some other
interesting cars as well, such a hard-tuned, non-racing GTO'95 MR.
