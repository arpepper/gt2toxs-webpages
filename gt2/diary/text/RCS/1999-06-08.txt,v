Another two Abnormal Series wins leave only one race prize car to go!!!

Well, tonight I won the Abnormal Series once more with a Cerbera.
Unfortunately, it won a duplicate light blue Trueno.

So I took the R32Skyline GT-R'89 from the back of my garage, and
raced it in the series.  It turns out I had earlier set camber to
3.0F/3.5R, which really does seem to help control.  I remember
springs were 4.1F/4.0R, stabilizers 3/3.

It won all races except Autumn Ring.  It came close to the record
at the Autumn Ring, and finished fourth again.  It set new records
at High-Speed Ring, and Grand Valley, and shattered the records at 
SSR11.  It seemed a little slower on the Clubman R5 track; maybe
I should add more turbo for that.  Generally I ran spec 4 with
normal intercooler, but at Autumn Ring I ran spec 3, still with
no intercooler, and with reduced final drive.  More turbo (intercooler)
should help go even faster at High Speed Ring, too.

It won the pink Trueno!

So that leaves only the yellow '91 Skyline to go.
