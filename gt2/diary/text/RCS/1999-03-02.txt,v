Beginning emphasis on cataloging used car inventory.

Threads:
  Used Car Patterns
  Used Car Information

Entries will be brief for the next few days (or weeks) as I begin
catalogin the used car inventory.  Last night as a side-effect of
doing that I discovered the cheap 4wd car available at day 1, and
took it out for a test run.

Thread:  Used Car Information

It is a "Fiji Blue" Mitsubishi GTO '92 SR, for only Cr8860.  With
221bhp, although 3769lb, I managed to win a spot race at Grand Valley
East after one loss.  However, the Supra which won the first time did
not show up the second time.  I have not finessed it onto a card with a
B license, but I think it would be capable of winning the Sunday Cup
straight out of the box, since the cars at the Sunday Cup seem to try
harder to let you win than do the Spot Race competitors.

I believe I have read about this car in other web pages.  It does make
an interesting strategy.  Fully dressed, it could certainly win the
4wd series, but figures indicate you cannot hop it up enough to be
a JPvs series contender.
