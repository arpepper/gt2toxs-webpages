I got my A class license!!!

Based on mail to Nick.


Thread: License Test Progress

Strange, I had thought I'd manage to get all the Arcade red bonus dots first.
I've got all but four red dots.  None on Trial Mountain (I have done a
concerted effort at it yet), and I am having trouble with B class on
Deep Forest.  C class I won after persisting with a field in which I
noticed that the car which started second consistently moved up and
finished first.  That can cause interference which you can take
advantage of.

A class.
My wife stayed overnight at her sister's on Wednesday, and so I stayed
up far too late.  First I went back and reassured myself by redoing all
my B class tests.  That is a waste of "days" in the simulation, since
you end up wanting to keep all the records.  8-)  I got lots of silvers,
and gold for the start/stop tests.  The second start/stop I didn't get
gold until I accidentally put it in automatic.  So there I learned that
in automatic you get automatic optimal downshift help.  Can be useful
on some courses and tests, but in general I find I want to know what
gear I'm in and don't want the torque at the wheels suddenly changing,
etc.  E.g. I tested automatic on Arcade Deep Forest B, and seemed to
lose about 5 or 10 seconds a lap.  Their shifting is reasonably good,
but can't, e.g. anticipate a hill or bend which makes a marginal
upshift detrimental.

I guess it does say in the manual, but it's still sort of disappointing
when you do a silver time not as good as your previous silver time and
so only get a bronze "prize".  It's sort of fun when G.T. Silver
disappears from the records...

One of the cornering tests, and the final are still bronze.  Quite quickly
I got a time on the final about .05 seconds over silver, but never got
any better.  (Final is Eunos around High Speed Ring).

I realized that the biggest problem in Gran Turismo had helped make it
difficult to pass the cornering tests the first time.  The corners
looked like ninety-degree corners, but are almost 180.  (I recognize it
now, of course, as Deep Forest).  I exacerbated that problem by using
"wide" view option.  You need to apex a lot later than visual input
alone suggests.  If I were making up the tests, I would include a
simple ninety-degree cornering test.  Maybe two; one with long straight
before, another with long straight afterwards.  I now use "narrow"
view, and the problem is less severe, but still noticeable.

So things clicked for the A tests.  I finished A-7 before A-6.  I did
not need to use the handbrake to get bronze in the A-7 test even though
they say you do.  I just drove conservatively and tight.

A-6, a twiddly section from Deep Forest, stumped me for a while.  It
was gratifying that I used my head to solve it.  I realized that
on the second sharp corner, before the short straight into the
second tunnel, you needed to apex late (go deep) so you got better
acceleration into what is essentially the finishing straight.
So, on a time when braking, downshifting, turning and then accelerating
through the first sharp corner all came together, I concentrated on
going a bit deep into the second, and sure enough, I got my bronze.

A-8 was weird.  It took me a relatively long time to learn to keep the
Supra RZ on the road and even get a time.  That was about 4 seconds
over.  The car tends to understeer a lot and is difficult to provoke
into oversteer at all.  In fact, I went and checked the specs because I
began to suspect it was a stupid 4WD.  Anyway, shortly after the
first run which got a time, I came down to within a second of my
bronze.  Sometime after that was a run where I 360'd twice in the
first hairpin but somehow did not "FAIL", so I kept going for the
practice.  So, I begin remembering A-3 and A-4 and how long they took,
and I decide "you're not going to get this one tonight", and just
relaxed and thought of it as educational practice at both conscious and
subliminal levels.  And so what happens, but a few runs later everything
comes together reasonably well and I get 1:17.556, almost 1/2 second
under.  (And I probably hadn't reset the game as recently as I would
have if I had expected to pass  8-).  I'm up to almost 1000 days now;
I really think they should announce "New Year's" for you.  Play
Auld Lang Syne or something).

This is almost like a diary.  I keep all my outgoing mail.  Some of
this might be synthesizable into Web pages if I can decide on a focus.

So, now it's almost late and really I should to bed, but after saving
the final replay (it obviously wasn't perfect, and didn't feel so as I
did the run, and will probably be very good for analysis), and saving
the game state with the A license, I wanted to make use of it.

I'd read that the "Clubman Series" was a good way to make a bit of
Chromium (that's what "Cr" stands for, isn't it??? 8-)), and so I
entered that.  Not knowing what to expect, I used my racing Cerbera.

Comments on the entry screen say "requires advanced racing skills", so
I felt glad that I had chosen the racing Cerbera.  However, really the
screen should say "requires advanced racing skills or a car which
absurdly outclasses the field".  First race, Autumn Ring, I crank up
the final drive, try some practice, seem pretty smooth, start to
qualify, and it's a total disaster.  But, I note, that my initial test
run (from standing start) was 4 seconds faster than the first place
qualifier.  So that was encouraging.  Race starts, and I tear away in
front, no problem with the hairpins, but then I lose it completely
on the 270degree corner after the underpass, forgetting about my
upshift quick spin recovery technique.  So I'm way back in 6th, and
think, well they'll wait a little, so maybe I'll salvage 5th or 4th,
but, no, I easily manage to get back into first just before the
underpass the second time.  So I take it really easy from there on.
The section up the hill to the "stadium" part is tricky too.  Each car
seems to need a different technique,  so, I loaf along.  This turns out
to be enough to actually anger the handicapping algorithm into sending
a car past me.  But I just stay behind and power past it on the final
straight.  Advanced driving techniques, don't you know.

So then on Clubman R5 and Trial Mountain I get pole and win both,
leading from start to finish.  I really hate that Clubman track, the
way it's not worth trying to avoid "clipping" the walls.  And portions
of my drive around Trial Mountain made me think "Nobody needs to buy
Test Drive Offroad; this is like an off-road test drive".  But with a
car like the Cerbera you can get away with all that nonsense and win
anyway.  So I win my first Camaro (of probably many more to come),
along with all the quite generous associated Chromium.  Oh well,
sometime when I've got more time I'll enter tougher series and take
proper amounts of practice time with whatever car I'm using, and try to
make it all look more elegant.  And I can remember that this series
exists to finance my bad habits even faster than the Sunday Cup.

And I must admit those A-class tests do help with taking the trickier
parts of Trial Mountain.

The fact they have only 11 tracks and run them backwards to get more
indicates they are short of space on the CD.  (Trial Mountain II
actually has the arrows going the wrong way!!!)  This is unfortunate
because I think it would be fun if the "game map" actually corresponded
to a simulated village you needed to drive around.  Portions of the
village would probably look suspiciously like portions of the R5 and
R11 courses.  There could be cops who would give you tickets for
speeding and dangerous driving.  I'm not sure how you'd get around to
buy your first car, or get back after a sale, however.  8-)  (GTTA?
Gran Turismo Transit Authority?)  (Gee, maybe they could make you racer
by day, Leisure Suit Larry by night.  The more races you win, the
more...)  8-)

Another fantasy enhancement is a 1929 Bentley, but I'm not sure if
their car drawing routines could handle that, let alone the problem
with getting a physics model for it.  And licensing.  It would probably
feel like a pig to drive anyway.

Thread: Children

I wonder, what's the youngest age at which children can really
appreciate Gran Turismo?  When can children understand manual
transmission?  I vaguely remember understanding it between
grade 6 and grade 7 (roughly, um, add 5, 11 years old).

I have observed that pole times for Spot Races seem to be better than
ones for the same track in the Sunday Cup.

If so, it might be nice to indicate somehow that Sunday Cup and
Clubman Cup are actually easier than Spot Races.  The two series
seem to be just an easy way to raise Cr (And Demios and Camaros) to
support your habits.  Not having different values for different
prize cars is "not a nice touch".  I.e. different values for
different prize cars would be "a nice touch".

For all races it would be nice to give some winning times, or "time
needed to win".  Best time is sort of irrelevant.  Worst winning time
(by a human) would be more relevant.  8-)  Time of computer winner when
you come close second is probably best indicator of needed time, but
the handicap algorithm is strange.  More strictly, time of computer
winner when you drove a clean race and came a close second might
indicate the time.  (Since if you have a catastrophe, they do seem
to wait for you).  Time of second place competitor is some indication,
but in some series they seem to hang just behind you no matter how
fast you go, or, to a point, how slow you go.

In Sunday Cup, High Speed Ring, the strange handicapping algorithm
which usually manages to finish a car about 1 second behind you
fails as you can leave all 5 cars > 10 seconds behind.  8-)
Of course, once you get to >13 seconds or so, you can't even tell
how far ahead you were.  8-(  (On other tracks I think I've had
up to about 5 or 6 seconds before the 2nd place car).

Thread: Driving Advice

Although I didn't need it for B-1, I'd suggest to people that they
use an automatic transmission for B-1 and B-2 if they want to get gold
quickly, because the computer optimally downshifts (engine brakes) for
them when they brake.  This seemed sort of counter-intuitive to me,
but it makes sense when you think about how the cars are emulated and
the goals of the game designers.

Conversely, attempting to get gold in B-2 using manual transmission
would be a good way to learn to quickly downshift properly.  I've
come to the conclusion that if you over-downshift, the emulation
acts on the assumption that your clutch is out until car speed is low
enough to match maximum engine speed.  That is, you lose your engine
braking until the car is slow enough for the new gear.  Do you think
that is the case?

Another good place to practice proper downshifts is A-3 and A-8.  I
actually ended up using automatic in A-3, but got my bronze in 
A-8 with manual.  It is nice to stay in the same gear as you manipulate
the throttle.  But in A-3 my lack of co-ordination seemed to over-ride
that concern.  But in arcade mode I tried automatic to see if it would
help my Mitsubishi Eclipse win Difficult in Deep Forest Racing Way and
it seemed to drastically reduce my times.  (it is actually "Racing
Way", isn't, it, not "Raceway").

Proper downshifting is difficult, of course, because you need, for each
gear of each car, to determine what tach speed in that gear corresponds
to the red-line in the next lower gear.  For upshifting, you basically
just shift when you hit the red-line.  (You may want to shift a little
later if there is a big jump to the next gear, or earlier if the next
gear is very close).  Of course, that infinitely-variable "racing
gearbox" can be used to make the downshift tach speed a constant as
well.  8-)  Good thing I wasn't in charge of the project, or you'd
have to choose gears and final-drive from a (large) set of discrete
integer ratios.  8-)  (I'd express them as decimals, but I think it
would be more realistic and in someways simpler to limit the
granularity).  Even when shifting by ear, you don't get a definite
clue when to downshift, because actual engine speed will be different
for different downshifts.  In real-life in one's one and only car,
one learns what each gear sounds like when the engine could stand
the gear one lower, and also knows the speed ranges (if one has a
cheap car without a tach; notice how all Japanese cars with automatics
come with tach because automatic is more luxurious than tach, but
most Japanese cars with manual do not have a tach because they are
economy packages?).  Drivers who regularly drive different cars, or
cars with different gearing setups, must develop strategies for
remembering these things.

By-the-way, you have surely noticed that one can set the gear ratios in
GT in inappropriate orders.  I.e. set 3rd to be lower than 2nd.  Or
does something notice before you try and save it?  I should try that
sometime.  When I get bored of trying to finish in each position in
each of the spot races, or something.  8-)

Hey.  That would be good.  A page of silly things like that (try to
finish in each position in each spot race) to try when you're feeling
bored or frustrated with Gran Turismo.  I guess "try driving a car
with badly order-gear ratios" might be another.  Hmm... Perhaps it
does notice because what would that do to its automatic gear
shifting algorithms?  Aaa... It would probably just end up more-or-less
skipping the bad gear.
