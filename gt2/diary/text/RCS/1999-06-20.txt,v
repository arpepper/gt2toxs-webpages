[R]R32SkylineGT-R'89 Respectably Wins SSR11 All-Night I

Threads:
  All-Night I Results

I started another game ("blue" game, after the colour of its memory card).
I'm trying to use what I've learned to quickly get all prize cars, but
am not really having all that much luck.  8-(

Anyway, as a diversion from the frustration of entering multiple
International races, only to get duplicate prize cars, I entered
the [R]R32SkylineGT-R'89 in the SSR11 All-Night I.  Note that
the records are for the new game.  This run with this car was
about 30 seconds slower than the GTO'95MR, but I wasn't in best
form and think I could do better.

I didn't bother with practice runs, or analysing tire wear, but
tentatively went with the 8,16,23 strategy.  I would have changed
it only if wear was obviously much more or much less.

I led from stat to finish, lapping all but one car twice.  I
lapped the first car on lap 12, and lapped some just before
my second pit stop, meaning I had to re-pass them.

I had a couple of minor disasters, and it does take a while to
recover this car on this course, particularly because of the turbo.

As you can see, this was a very fast field, with lots of depth, 
and no real "slow-pokes".  (Lancer, Accord, etc)

I won Cr150,000, and a red Silvia LM.
