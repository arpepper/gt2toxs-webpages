Trying to Express My Thoughts about Race-Series Prize-Cars

Threads:
  Prize Car Patterns

In the Normal and Tuned Series I think the cars are awarded a bit more
evenly than true random distribution would give.  It only took me 10
wins, which would be on the low side of expectations if the cars were
truly awarded randomly.  (Try rolling a die, and see how long it
usually takes you to get all six numbers; this morning I took 19,13,13,17).

According to a semi-brute-force program I wrote, you have only the
following chance of getting all six on or before:

      #     comb      total       prob
    races   all 6     combs       all 6
       6         6 / 46656        .0154
       7     15120 / 279936       .0540
       8    191520 / 1679616      .1140
       9   1905120 / 10077696     .1890
      10  16435440 / 60466176     .2718
      11 129230640 / 362797056    .3562

And after that, I need to work around an overflow problem before I can
report further.  8-)  (Or remember some less brute-force probability
theory).  The above intuitively makes sense to me, but I may have made
a mistake.  8-(  As you get more prize cars (or die rolls), it actually
becomes more likely you will get ones you already have, making it quite
difficult to actually collect all of them.

And I seemed to win the last car after I took the new car I had been
using (Viper RT/10) and racked up some other series wins for it.


In order:

   [A few losses up here...]
    1. GTO'95 MR     white Trueno
   [LONG gap in here...]
    2. GTO'95 MR     blue Trueno
    3. GTO'95 MR     blue Trueno   8-(
    4. GTOtwinturbo  blue Skyline
    5. Cerbera       red Skyline
    6. Cerbera       blue Trueno   8-(
    7. R32GT-R'89    pink Trueno
   [Bought my first Viper RT/10, and entered it in the Tuned Series straight away]
    8. ViperRT/10    blue Trueno   8-(
    9. ViperRT/10    white Trueno   8-(
   [In here, RT/10 won A-level GT-League, plus FR, then I powered off for night]
   10. ViperRT/10    yellow Skyline   8-) 8-) 8-)


Apart from the Viper, all other cars were quite old and had somewhat
extensive racing histories.


A car which has been winningly raced in a lot of other series seems to
have a better than random chance of getting a new prize car in a
"target" series.  I suspect records of these wins are stored in the
"shared" portion of the cars records, ie with the "lifetime" supply
of parts, since it seems cars in which another "instance" has done
well will also do well.

The Normal series came off even faster, with 8 wins (i.e only two
duplicates).  I don't have detailed notes here, but I won with Viper
GTS several times, then lost with a Griffith 500 at one point, and
won a duplicate car after that with the Griffith 500, and won the
final car first time out with a Griffith 4.0, after preparing in
Sunday Cup and Clubman and FR.  (Race-modded Griffiths of both types
had previously raced extensively in vain, hunting for the elusive
yellow ConceptCar).

In contrast, some of the "International Series" prize cars seem really
"locked out" (or others "locked in"!) for a long time.  In a
"test" game a prize ConceptCar, not raced in any other series, won a
white/blue Viper GTS-R in 5 out of 5 (not all consecutive) USvsJP
entries, while a race-mod Viper and a race-mod GTO'95MR both turned up
black FTO's first time.  That Viper first won the yellow ConceptCar for
me, in that game, after I first won all of GT league (including GT-I)
with it, plus FR, and then won UKvsUS three times, getting three
different cars.  So, later I tried doing the same thing with a race-mod
Viper in my "main" game, and, sure enough, a yellow ConceptCar was
finally won there!

I cannot believe this is all due to faulty use of faulty random number
generation routines, as is suggested by at least one FAQ.

I know for a fact that racing models are not penalized, prize-car-wise,
for entering non-racing series.  (This is, however, about the only
definite fact I can state).

I'll post about this to r.g.v.s soon.

Here is the same table for 4 cars (or 4-sided dice)

    #      comb    total        prob
  races    all 4   combs        all 4
    4         24 / 256          0.0938
    5        240 / 1024         0.2344
    6       1560 / 4096         0.3809
    7       8400 / 16384        0.5127
    8      40824 / 65536        0.6229
    9     186480 / 262144       0.7114
   10     818520 / 1048576      0.7806
   11    3498000 / 4194304      0.8340
   12   14676024 / 16777216     0.8748
   13   60780720 / 67108864     0.9057
   14  249401880 / 268435456    0.9291
If prize cars were awarded randomly, and you entered an International
Series 15 times, you would have a 95% chance of getting all four
cars by that time (and a 5% chance of not doing!)

Here's the numbers for 2 car series.

    2      2 / 4       0.5000
    3      6 / 8       0.7500
    4     14 / 16      0.8750
    5     30 / 32      0.9375
    6     62 / 64      0.9688
    7    126 / 128     0.9844
    8    254 / 256     0.9922
    9    510 / 512     0.9961
   10   1022 / 1024    0.9980
   11   2046 / 2048    0.9990
   12   4094 / 4096    0.9995
   13   8190 / 8192    0.9998
   14  16382 / 16384   0.9999
   15  32766 / 32768   0.9999

I.e. by 6 or 7 tries, you really should have got both cars.
But I seemed to get both cars in two tries in all both of
those races.  Which the above says is somewhat unlikely.
(Though the probability of it happening is 1 in 4, so it's not very
unlikely).

(This table's easy; # of combinations is 2^n, and there are only two
combinations at any n which do not include both, namely all the
first, or all the second).
