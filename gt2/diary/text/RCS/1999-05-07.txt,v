[R]Supra RZ (race-modded Normal Series prize car) wins Grand Valley 300

Threads:

  Prize Car Information

Well, this race-modded Supra RZ looked quite promising for the
Grand Valley 300, having set a few records in the UKvsJP series,
including holding the covetted Grand Valley East ii total time
record at 2:44.576, and SSR11 at 5:19.564

I ran with 779bhp (Spec 4, normal intercooler, semi-racing exhaust).

                      (13out) 1:46.521

So, this car won fairly handily, not quite as handily as I expected,
but was a little faster than the del Sol LM.

Once again, I got to a slow start, but this time I got the lead
by lap 5.  I barely maintained my lead after the first pit stop
(I knocked the leading CASTROL SUPRA GT out of control as it
went by the pit exit just as I came out).

I passed all the field on the road (as opposed to in the pits).  That
was fun!

Note how close together the first three AI cars finished.  Too bad
I wasn't able to view that excitement!

After the race I set a 3:13.880 2 lap Grand Valley time trial.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

The next Grand Valley 300 entrant will be the race-modified Viper GTS.
(The red one, not to be confused with the white GTS-R).  This car
managed a 3:16.247 two-lap Grand Valley time trial, putting it in
a class with the FTO LM and Castrol Supra GT.

After that I attempted practice at UKvsUS, and swept the first series
45 to 25 (winning yet another purple ConceptCar).  At the end of
qualifying for the first race of my second try, however, the game
froze, indicating that the ambient temperature in our house is getting
somewhat warmer, because I had not been playing for all *that* long.
