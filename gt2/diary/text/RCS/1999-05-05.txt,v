Well, the del Sol LM Edition got the job done, but it didn't do as well
in the Grand Valley 300 as I had thought it might.

I got off to a slow start, as you can tell from the first lap time.
The Skyline appeared to go off very strongly, with the twin turbo
right behind it.  I was third a lot before the first pit stop,
although I was jostling strongly for second by lap 3.  I had
just barely caught up to first place when it was time for my first
pit stop.

I was clearly in control after the second pit stop, holding the lead
from then on, and lapping the entire field eventually.

I had no real disasters in the race, but at least one near one.  I'm
not sure how I managed to turn the one 1:34.000; I had very few laps
even below 1:36 apart from that.

Afterwards I did a two lap Grand Valley time trial, creating a ghost
very close (on the same second; 3:11.XXX for two laps) to the Cerbera
LM.

Essentially, the del Sol LM seems to be a difficult car to drive
consistently very well, although it is an easy car to drive
consistently not badly.  So it's strange that it could not come
closer to the 1-38 time I managed with the Cerbera LM.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

The next Grand Valley 300 entrant will be the race-modded Supra RZ;
the Normal Car Series prize car.  It turns out that Supra cannot be
made quite as powerful as one you buy from the dealer!  But even
so, running between 779 and 897hp, it is a handful to control.

Early tests indicated it might beat my Cerbera LM time, but now I am
not so sure.
