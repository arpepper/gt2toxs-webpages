Turn it on, Wind it up, Blow it out, GTO!

  Grand Valley 300 Results
  Race Results
  Special Model Information

Well, I had thought that my ability might combine with the Mitsubishi
special GTO LM Edition's poor power-to-weight ratio to allow me to
fill in another box in the Grand Valley 300km Endurance Race prize
money list.  Well, in that effort I was disappointed, but in return
I was rewarded with a fun, pleasant, and mildly challenging race.

Before racing I dropped the final drive slightly, and that seemed
to help.  In addtion, I was gradually getting used to the seven
speed gearbox which necessitates picking higher gears than one
gets into the habit of.

Anyway, here's the results...

I did not lead the race until after the other GTO's first pitstop,
which occurred after mine.  I think I had only one minor loss of
control during the race.

The race was quite exciting because nearly every time I pitted I lost
the lead, but usually got it back in one or two laps because I had
fresh tires whereas the "AI" GTO was by then always on very worn
tires.  For simplicity, the AI cars do no calculations about their
pitstops, but just pit in when their tires are too worn.  This gives
you a big advantage, but you need the nerves to relinquish the lead (or
the immediate chance at the lead), and the discipline to race fast
against time on your fresh tires, so you can take the lead when the AI
cars do pit.

Note that my winning margin amounts to only slightly more than a
quarter second a lap.

I nearly lapped the Impreza, but let it go by on the last lap.

Of course, I won Cr300,000 plus a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

This field was back to being not so competitive.  I almost certainly
would have placed the special NSX-R LM GT2 fourth in this field.
Maybe even third.

The next contender will be the special Nissan NISMO GT-R LM Edition,
a nice racing version of the FR Skylines.  It seems middling competitive,
nice to drive, although giving hints of rear-end breakaway.  In practice
last night it won the UKvsJP series 45 to 22, and won a red del Sol.
It seems sort of strange it did not win a green Cerbera, but I'm not
positive that I have not raced this car in that series before.  The car
seemed especially good at SSR5, perhaps because of its somewhat harsh
settings, and would have set a fastest lap record had the RX-7 not
copped it last night.

Time trials at Grand Valley suggest this car will be controllable
enough to do well in the Grand Valley 300.

Thread: Gameplay Hints

This morning I tried an experiment I've been meaning to do for a
while.  I filled my garage with bargain basement Silvias, and then won
the Sunday Cup to see what it would do about the prize car it might
want to give me.  Well, it simply skips that screen entirely.  In other
words, if you don't have room in your garage, you forfeit the prize
car, with no announcement.
