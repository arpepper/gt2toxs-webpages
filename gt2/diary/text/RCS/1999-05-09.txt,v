[R]GTO'95 MR beats even the ConceptCar in SSR11 All-Night I

Threads:

I had so much success with the [R]GTO '95 in warm-up races, including
setting new personal records at SSR11, that I decided it was a shoe-in
for the SSR11 event.  And, sure enough, that was the case.

I did a full ten laps of test run, to allow me to try and do some
optimal pitstop analysis.

Raw Data was:

    6 laps    10:29    54:05est
    8 laps    14:00    53:45est
   10 laps    17:37    53:40est

So my theory that the tire wear algorithm parameters are designed to
make it not terribly important when you take pit stops sort of holds
up.  Although the above does confirm my intuition that every 6 laps,
even if it seems necessary, is too often.  So I went with the 8,16,23
strategy.

Wow.  I must have been a little pumped up for this one.

I led from stat to finish, lapping the entire field twice.
I did not notice the first time I lapped them, so that must
have been while they were in the pits.

I had a couple of minor disasters, but am learning to recover this
car quickly on this course.

I won Cr150,000, and a green Silvia LM.

After this race, I set a record at Grand Valley in the 4wd Challenge.

According to all FAQs, I have all my cars for that event, so, of
course, the green Lancer EvolIV GSR I won was a duplicate.
