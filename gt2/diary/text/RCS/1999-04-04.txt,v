Second time lucky at GV300  8-)

  Grand Valley 300 Results
  Prize Car Information

Well, I decided to cheat and take the Concept Car to the GV300, so I
managed to win it that way.   1-34:05.004

Lapped the entire field, of course.  Two or three times, I think.
Pit stops 14,28,40,51  I think.  I won a black and green Castrol
Supra GT.  Somewhat icky-looking car, really.

I discovered that R1 or R2 and L1 or L2 space you through your garage
faster, but they do not have that effect on the "results" screen which
lists all sixty laps for you, so I could not make proper notes or
do other proper analysis.  (I.e. stupid me at X:30AM (X+1:30AM EDT)
decided to experiment on the results screen of the GV300 instead of
some inconsequential race; R1/R2,L1/L2 act just the same there as
any button other than arrows, and take you to the next screen...)

Bounces a leetle like that, but nothing you can't control.  Raise the
dampers, and it bounces more!  The severe stabilizer settings tends
to keep the rear-end in check (especially rotationally), but can
actually get you crossed up exiting a corner, so you learn to watch for
that and stop it from happening.  I.e. you can't give it full gas till
you've exited a corner.

As far as I can tell, Demios, Concept Car and to a lesser extent TVRs
run into problems because their weight is actually below the parameters
where the physics model is designed to work well.  Some of the strange
things they do are also because of the way the game is designed to
prevent roll-overs; one of the pleasant things about GT is that you can
always drive out of any accident; the game never needs to "reset" you.
