Won an orange Supra in the Normal Car series.

Thread: Race Results

I guess those IA license tests sure do prepare you for the Normal Car
series.  Although I did lose (come 5th) at DFRW II, I won all the other
races and a couple of poles, winning that mass of prize money and an
orange Supra RZ, which looks sort of gold to me.  The most amazing
thing was at GVE II, when I went slightly off the track during my first
negotiation of the final hairpin.  I caught it and stopped it from
becoming a total disaster, but all four wheels were in the gravel, and
I was surprised that not one car passed me.  An examination of the
replay revealed that the 2nd place car had done the not unusual AI car
trick of going off onto the grass at the kink in the previous
straight.

At Autumn Mini II, I qualified 3rd, and won by a slim margin in spite
of engaging in plenty of "off-road" action.

At Clubman R5 II I got the pole and won easily (by such a large margin
that not one car revealed how far back it was before the screen
progressed to the next one).  GVE I won easily, even with the
aforementioned drama.

DFRW II, as I mentioned, was a disaster.  I qualified a distant sizth
and could not keep control of the car, finishing 5th.

On SSR 11, after a fourth place qualifying, I led from start to finish,
not even able to tell that the other contender (a TRD 3000GT) in the
series was running third most of the time (it dropped to fourth at the
end).  But the map showed me I had a long lead over the 2nd place car
(who turned out not to be a contender anyway), and so I took it real
easy (70mph versus ~100) through the deadly chicane for the last few
laps, to prevent a disaster.

I still haven't tried any of the IA races yet.  My wife objects to 5 lap
races because I can't talk for a long time (i.e. during them).  I'm not
sure what she'll think of a 60 lap race.  Or even 30 laps of hell.
Actually, SSR11 sort of grows on you after all those license attempts.
Hmm.  I have it memorized to the extent that I can sit here and
navigate it in my head.

I don't know when the other contender dropped to fourth; I saved the
replay, but when I watched it, it was cut off some time during the
fourth lap.  8-(  I would imagine that if I had watched it immediately
(ie. before saving) it would  have been similarly cut off.  There's
only so much memory available, after all.  The replay claims to be 71
blocks; I'm not sure if that is the cut-off size, or not.  I could not
find anything in the manual mentioning a limit on replay data size.

Oh yes, this was all driving a Viper GTS, of course.  Red, of course.  8-)

Occasionally I get hours alone.  Many of my license tests were passed
in the wee hours one day when my wife had gone to visit her sister, for
instance.  So I might be able to try the long IA races at a similar
time.

But she likes having me play Gran Turismo beside her (we have two
screens in our living room  8-) ) so I can only half-watch the TV shows
which she is choosing.  I have my own universal remote and she doesn't
like it when I change the channel on her, as I'm wont to do during
commercials when I'm not playing.  8-)  But she likes to be able to
talk to me at least once every 6 minutes, so 10 minute races are too
long.  8-)

One thing I'm going to have to do is construct a race-prepared stock
Viper, as opposed to the GTS-R prize.  Specs suggest it should be
slightly better, and I find the GTS-R prize difficult to get
performance out of.  Little strange things like a tendency to get
snagged on the inside of corners, and such.  Then I'll have to see if I
can do any better in the USvs series with a prepared Viper than I did
with the prize car.  Of course, I didn't mind winning the USvsUK series
in a race-prepared Cerbera (not LM edition).  8-)

I find it interesting that the game parameters suggest it is legitimate
for someone to buy ("trade" for) an LM car from someone else for a
measly Cr35000.  Sort of like someone lost a zero somewhere, or something.

145 more HP, 360 more pounds; not a lot to choose between maxed Cerbera
and the LM edition, one way or the other.
