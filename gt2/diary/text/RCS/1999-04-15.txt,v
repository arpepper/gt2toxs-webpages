Silly Things with a Viper

Threads:
  Gameplay Hints

Well, I think a really good driver could win the Clubman Cup with a
completely stock Viper, but for Cr15,000 plus a bit for stabilizers,
I think I'd go with just racing tires and stabilizers; it's pretty
easy like that.

After goofing around with that, I took a fully tuned Viper to
the GVE Spot Race, and won in 3:10.759


total       lap 1      lap 2
-----       -----      -----
3:10.759 = 2:07.883 + 1:02.876

The track (in arcade mode) claims to be 1.880 miles.  So I make that

70.96mph    52.92mph   107.64mph   average speeds for the corresponding times.

That was my first and only attempt at slow racing.

A site of "worst (winning) times" might be funny.

Another thing I did with a fairly tuned Viper was attempt to
recreate the game Demo 1 (GT Cup Grand Valley win with a blue Viper).
It's not easy to make an exciting looking demo in which you win; if you
can win a race, you tend to run away with it too soon.
