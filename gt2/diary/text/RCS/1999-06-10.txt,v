I finally won at Autumn Ring ii, in the Abnormal Series

The Autumn Ring is really bad backwards, I think.  You do not see the
view where you would be looking when driving in real-life as you go
past the start/finish to the esse just after it.

But last night I finally won there in the Tuned Series, with a Viper
RT/10.  Cranked final drive way down (up in number, from 3.8 to 4.5).

Funny thing was I won with 5:58.323, but the next time around I spun on
lap 2 at the hairpin leading to the start/finish, and only finished
3rd.  But the winning time was 5:55.xxx (and my time was 5:59.571).

Although I came close, neither time did I match the Cerbera lap record of
about 1:09.6xx; also I did not get pole either time.

And although I won the Abnormal Series twice, I got a white Trueno
the first time, and a blue one the second.  I.e. no new prize
cars.  (I.e. not the remaining one--the yellow Skyline).

Thread: Driving Advice

My favourite course is Grand Valley East ii.  I like to think I use the
style which is appropriate for each corner.  8-)  If you like throwing
a car into a corner, you might actually want it to understeer.  You
want to be able to *provoke* oversteer, to spin it around, but after
that you might want a nice drift on both ends to carry it sideways
around the corner.  That can involve final understeer.  (More efficient
than using lots of opposite lock, and helps prevent spin-outs).

I examine tracks to see where I should go slow to go faster later.  E.g.
at Grand Valley East ii, although you can go very fast through the first
corner, the next corner you should pull-up a little early, and hold
tight, so that you get a wider smoother line for the next turn and
thereby a faster run into the tunnel.

After the tunnel, it is quite tricky.  You learn just where to brake
to go around that near-hairpin with a minimum of lost speed, then
smooth out the next left-hander.  Then comes the really tricky part.
You clip the next slight right-hander, and turn a little early for the
left-hander after it, and allow your drift to take you to the outside
(right-hand side) of the track.  The AI cars nearly always come off on
this corner!!!  You gain a lot of time in the Normal Series right
there.  After that, resist the temptation to straighten up early, but
rather let your car drive across to the left-side of the track and
smoothly bring it parallel, and then back across to the right-hand
side.  Ghosts showed me you lose a lot of time if you try to
"straighten" the corner by pulling right early, because you actually
sharpen it.  After the straight you throw the car into the hairpin in a
manner which suits its particular handling (must prepare a lot earlier
with 4wd cars; they tend to slip entirely sideways, whereas with an FR
you can use its tendency to spin to send you around the corner), and
drive off smoothly to the finish line.

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

An e-mail correspondent wrote to tell me he picked up the green RX-7 A
spec yesterday, and got two more golds in his A licence, leaving just
test 4 and 8 left for A class gold.

The green RX7 seemed common as nails in my games.  8-)

It seems strange to me that he's got so many golds, but has not won the
Abnormal Series yet.  Especially since the other cars co-operate so
much to help you win the series that you can usually win it with 30
points.  (They don't co-operate to help you win or do well in
individual races, though, except perhaps the High Speed Ring).  I won
twice with the Cerbera with only two race wins each time.

The only "real" gold I have is B-7.  B-1,B-2, and A-7 do not count.  8-)
I have all my license cups, but the following are still bronze:
A-3,A-8,IA-2,IA-4,IA-5,IA-6 and IA-8.  The rest are silver, except for
the 4 golds.

Another thing I did today was finally publish on the web my HTML forms
I print off for recording race results.
