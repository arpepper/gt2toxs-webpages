                      (16out) 1:36.846

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

I lapped the field at lap 11, and lapped some twice by lap 15.

I did have a couple of disasters, mostly involving traffic.

I did a couple of 1:26 times, and many 1:27's, fairly consistent
times.

Afterwards in GV Time Trials I did:

   1:32.468    +  1:26.528    =  2:59.016rec
   1:33.579    +  1:26.422rec =  3:00.001
