More about the Abormal Series

Someone asked me why I call the "Hard-Tuned Car Speed Contest" the
"Abnormal Series".

Well, it's on the screen there right beside "Normal", and, well a
900+ bhp mid-range Japanese 4wd sports car does seem somewhat
"abnormal".  8-)

I also wasn't explicit about "the trap" at the first corner in
Clubman R5ii.

If you leave that first corner too late, you can end up in the
blocked-off straight which would lead to SSR5ii.  In addition to facing
a flat wall of tyres, if you move along the wall there is a ridge on
the edge where the wall for the corner meets it, but juts out beyond
it, making it even more difficult to extricate yourself.  To add to the
confusion, the game's (er, simulator's) drawing routines get a bit
confused when you're there.  I'm beginning to realize, though, you can
see this corner coming, even at > 200mph in a GTO by watching for the
lane markers to appear on the right.

Now talking about the SSR11 circuit, and the deadly chicane near the
end, in the "Abnormal Car" Contest you're going around the SSR11
circuit backwards, so that is actually near the beginning of the
circuit.  In both cases, if you're out on your own, you can gain lots
of time by braking early, turning early, and thereby making the second
corner as wide and fast as possible.

If an AI car is near you, it will sometimes try to tempt you into braking
too late, and/or will obnoxiously knock you off course even if you brake
properly.  If you take it easy, however, although you might end up
behind it going through, you just *might* be able to get by again when
the AI car screws up its exit.  You might need to take it really easy,
though, so you can smoothly veer far left around a spun-out AI car.
It's best to be far ahead enough of the AI cars that you can brake
comfortably.

Talking about regular SSR11 (clockwise), I think if you are ahead of
the AI cars going into the final chicane they will not bother you
*unless* you screwed up the previous corner (slipped too much).  There
are two thresholds in most races, best illustrated by that track, such
that if you exceed the first but not the second, you might as well not
try any harder if you don't want to risk an accident.  In particular,
watch the central barrier chicane.  In the USvsUK series, as long as
you go through there somewhere close to 100mph, the AI cars will not
bother you, but go any faster, and they still stay just as close.  In
USvsJP and UKvsJP, however, you can more easily get way ahead on that
race, e.g. by negotiating those barriers really fast.

As far as the chicane at the beginning of the reverse-course SSR11 ii
goes, it seems the AI cars generally give you a lot of room there,
compared to the normal direction.  You can brake comfortably early in
the previous corner, speed up only a little for the short straight, and
then brake early so as to be able to negotiate the chicane smoothly.
And, if you do it smoothly, the AI cars don't seem to bother you.

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

I did win with the Tuned Cerbera, actually, but I only got 30 points,
so the game "helped me win".  It didn't help me win at Clubman Stage
Route 5 ii, though; there it insisted on sneaking by at the last corner
of the last lap, even though I thought I had everything under control.
And I spun out at Grand Valley, reducing a certain second or possible
first to 4th.  And well, then there's the Autumn Ring.  At least I
posted my best time so far there, and finished 4th.  So I entered SSR11
needing (barring a miracle) to win, and I did.  The Cerbera was Cooper
Green Metallic, by the way.

It won a *red* Skyline, so now there's only a yellow Skyline and a
pink Trueno to go in the race prize cars.
