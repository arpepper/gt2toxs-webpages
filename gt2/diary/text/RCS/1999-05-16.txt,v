[R]GTO'95 MR  Wins at Grand Valley A Third Time!

This time I ran the [R]GTO'95 MR with racing intercooler, and semi-racing
exhaust, instead of normal intercooler.

   [R]GTO'95 MR
   Grand Valley 300km Endurance Race

   q1st 1:36.268rec     Cr20,000

                      (21out) 1:42.685

So, I led from start to finish again.  The first two cars were lapped by
lap eight, and the third by lap 10, the field by lap 14; some cars
were lapped for the second time by lap 16.

A little eye irritation slowed me slightly after lap 20, but went
away after a couple of laps.

You can see this was an absurdly slow field.  In fact, the more I
try and remember the details, the more I think I must have done
this race *after* racing the tuned GTO'95 MR.  At times it's like
the game responds to the calibre of your previous entrant.

I believe I used the tuned car as a model to help with gear settings
suitable for use with heavier turbocharging.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

I was pleased that I took another 30 seconds off my time with this car.

First off, I could have come second, but let the GT-R ahead on the last
lap in order to confirm what 3rd place prize money was.  No really!!!

I was in a solid second place until my first pit stop.  Then I
dropped to 4th, got to 1st in the exchange, but was raced into
2nd.

lap 20 - dropped to 3rd.

lap 30 - dropped from  1st to 3rd again.

On the road, I just barely got 1st by lap 40, but my pit stop put
me in third.  8-(

My stop at lap 50 put me in a solid 2nd.  8-(  No last-minute stop
by the leader to put me in the lead this time...

In fact, the third place car did begin challenging me, but I could
have held him off.  In fact, it was quite difficult letting him
by for the last time.  (Note my very slow last lap time).

The next Grand Valley 300 entrant will be an encore performance by
the ConceptCar.  And, after that, I think I will take a rest.
