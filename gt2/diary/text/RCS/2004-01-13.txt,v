Red Is My Skyline

I haven't talked anything about
<font color="blue"><b>G</b></font><font color="red"><b>T</b></font><b>3</b>
yet, even though I purchased it about a month prior to actually getting a
<B>PS2</B> and started the game on May 16, 2002, achieving 100% on
October 27 the same year.  This is documented in
<a href="../logs/gt3-game1.txt">../logs/gt3-game1.txt</a>.

Recently I went back to try and get more gold in my licence tests.
Here is one result of that effort, expressing frustration at <b>B-8</b>.

<BR>
Red is my Skyline,<BR>
It doth not want (to get gold).<BR>
I drive it through the green pastures,<BR>
And past the still waters,<BR>
And into the Trial Mountains.<BR>
I will see no monkeys,<BR>
For this be a licence test.<BR>
<BR>
Yea, though I travel through the valley of the shadow of death,<BR>
Again and again and again...<BR>
Thy medal of gold and thy prize car appeareth not for to comfort me.<BR>
<BR>
My Skyline hath turbo-boost,<BR>
And V-spec options and four-wheel drive,<BR>
Yet it walloweth around in a manner like unto a '59 Caddy.<BR>
And, despite thine exhortations,<BR>
It understeereth not only when it doth accelerate,<BR>
But when it doth decelerate also.<BR>
<BR>
I fear there will be no goodness and mercy<BR>
To prevent me from committing at least one small error on each run.<BR>
So that with infrequence I will get within 5 hundredths,<BR>
But no closer,<BR>
And I will dwell in the ranks of silver medallists,<BR>
For ever.<BR>
<BR>
