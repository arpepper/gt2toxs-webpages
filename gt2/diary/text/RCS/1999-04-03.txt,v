Grand Valley 300K pays Cr200,000 for 2nd place  8-(

I proved recently that the prize [R]Toyota Chaser Lm can win both
JPvs series, although it has a harder time the second time through
the JPvsUS series.  SSR11 in JPvsUS is a lot harder than in
JPvsUK.

I took a 560bhp [R]Concept Car to all the GT League Events

Thread: Grand Valley 300 Results

I learned a GT fact last night (early this morning...)

Thread: Prize Money

2nd place in the GV300K pays Cr200,000  8-)

Oh well.  On the plus side I proved that the prize [R]Toyota Chaser can
win the two JPvs series.

The GV300K is a ball.  Cerbera LM, three pit stops, came 2nd by
+0:13.027, in 1-42'08"066  as they put it.  Oh well.
