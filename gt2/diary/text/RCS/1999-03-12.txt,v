Test Driving the pick of day 30, a S13 '91 Silvia K's 2000cc

  Used Car Information

Well, last night in addition to cataloging the rest of day 40, I went
back to day 30 and test-drove the "super black" S13 '91 Silvia K's
2000cc, 202bhp, available for only Cr9560.

Cr9560 leaves almost nothing left over for upgrades, but I did not need
them at all to win the trusty Sunday Cup.  I'd still rather drive a
Supra, but this car won the series easily, even getting the pole at
Autumn Ring-Mini.  I think it is probable capable of getting the pole
in all three races, and I could probably get all three poles with it if
I practised enough.  It doesn't exactly drive like a sports car,
though.

At Grand Valley East, I nearly blew it.  Coming into the hairpin the
second time around (I guess I had not practised that, doing only the
one qualifying lap), I lost it slightly, going off into the gravel and
then looping when I got back onto the pavement.  This left me in sixth
place, though not too far behind.  The car essentially powered to the
win from there on.  By the tunnel I was in third, got second through
the tunnel and I just drove around the outside of the MR2 in the last
few corners to win.  There was, um. "a little" contact.
