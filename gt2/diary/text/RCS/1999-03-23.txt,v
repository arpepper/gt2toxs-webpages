A Personal Comparison of the Prize Viper versus a Built-Up Viper

Threads:
  Prize Car Information

I had previously found the white prize Viper GTS-R frustrating to
drive.

So I "put together" a red one by race-modifying a purchased Viper GTS.
The red one is 578bhp, 2169lb versus 680bhp, 2753lb for the white
one--almost 600lb lighter.  But the default racing suspension
adjustment is the same for both, hmm...

Anyway, I have become a less worse driver, and won first USvsUK, almost
sweeping it.  I got 1st in all races, and pole except at SSR5 where I
qualified third.  I don't remember why.  I was a fairly long way from
my Cerbera LM records in all cases.  This won me another RX7 Aspec LM,
but blue instead of green.  Well, I think it's blue, I wouldn't call
it purple.

After that I won USvsJP, sweeping the series, with all five poles and
winning all five races.  I haven't raced that series since becoming
a less worse driver, so I broke most of my records too.  The red
Viper won another white Viper.  8-)

Alright, so a day later, I try with the white prize Viper.

UKvsUS, I won, with more difficulty, 4 races, coming 3rd at SSR11 after
messing up my first lap.  I took pole only at GVEii and HSR(!--by .005)
I won another blue RX7 Aspec LM which is probably still sitting on
the Mazda used car lot.  8-)

USvsJP, I won with a little more difficulty, although I did seem to be
eeking a little more speed out of the car.  Peak power is significantly
below red line for that car, and my qualifying seemed a little worse.
I won the first four races again, but SSR11 was a disaster; all five AI
cars seemed determine to race for a change, and I lost, but, of course,
still won the series, winning another white Viper.

So, it *seemed* that, even with extra power, the prize car was not as
good as the red one, although at least now I know how to stay out front
with it, except on one course  8-).

So I tried a test of truth.  I went to trusty old GVEii time trial, and
first took the white prize Viper for a spin.  Eventually, with a
struggle, it beat its ghost down to 1:59.xx

So then I took the red one out.  It easily left the (best) white ghost
way behind, finishing about 2 seconds faster.  (It must have been close
on the first lap, because I recall easily outdragging the ghost from
the last hairpin).  And a couple of tries later, I broke 1:00 on the
first lap, posting a 1:55.xxx; not only that, the car was comfortably
to drive.  Rather than struggling to keep control I could ponder where
to gain more time.  I had previously noticed an excessive tendency
for the GTS-R to "get stuck", e.g. on inside rumble strips of turns,
but noticed that less this time.

So, in short, a race-modified Viper GTS seems superior to a GTS-R, and
could give some drivers the edge they need to win the USvs series with
an American car.

Some of it might be tuning.  Should a car 25% heavier have spring rates
pretty close to 25% higher, or is it not directly linear?  I did
crank the white Viper's spring rates up .2 at both ends, and that did
seem to help and certainly not hurt (I run with full rear aero and
backed of slightly on the front on both cars).  But the biggest problem
seemed to be the weight penalty.  Both cars have 8litre V10 engines,
so I don't think the GTS-R engine is heavier.  So they should weigh the
same.  So it makes me wonder if the spec'd the racing modification for
an empty gas tank, and the GTS-R for a full one.  Or else they were
over-enthusiastic in spec'ing a "racing modification" for a production
car which is designed "race-modified".  Actually, the Cerbera LM versus
a fully-modified Cerbera has the same weight anomaly even though it
has the same size engine, but in that case the extra power (and handling?)
of the LM makes up for the weight.

Fuel consumption would be really neat in Gran Turismo.  Try to get too
much of a weight advantage, and you might not finish.  8-)  During longer
races, you might notice handling change as fuel is consumed.  And in
the GV300 you'd need to pit for fuel as well as tires.  The computer
would need to keep track of fuel consumption and weight changes for
the other five cars as well, though...

Of course, while white is a pretty good colour for making a car go
fast, red is way superior.  Jet Jaguar really should have a "colour
selection guide" section to his Tuning Guide.  8-)

Gees, I run on...

I finally found out how to see power curves for non-turbo engines,
e.g. GTS-R

In "the pits", you must go to "Change Parts" and select
"Turbocharger".  It then, I believe, shows you (although faintly) the
hp and torque curves.  For the GTS-R it appeared to correspond to the
numbers in the Spec sheet.  It looked like a very spiked power curve,
and a wide torque curve, with peak bhp much later than peak torque.
