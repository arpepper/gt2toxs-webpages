(GT1 Version 1.1)  GameShark Addresses and Codes for Simulation Race Parameters

Threads:
 Gameplay Hints
 Game Shark Hints

These next few days contain a lot of useful <html><b>GameShark</b></html> info
for <html><font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font> 1</html>.
It's not all concise or simple, so bear with me a bit.  I came back to fix
errors and remove some of the worst red herrings, but mostly I am
leaving it as I created it.  Eventually I'll publish a few concise
codes, but I hope the information I produce here along the way can
help other <html><b>GameShark</b></html> users, especially
<html><b>GameShark Pro</b></html> users to develop their own codes,
or at least understand the ones they do use from here and elsewhere.

There is an obvious chart of about $17 (23) numbered entries beginning
at $8008F8DC.  Analysis suggests it describes the license tests, so
presumably I mis-counted and there are 24 entries, and this has nothing
to do with race event setups.

Another table of pointers to race information begins at $8008F544 with
information for the Sunday Cup

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   8008F544 - 4 bytes points to Sunday Cup track list ($80090E0C)
   8008F548 - 4 bytes points to Sunday Cup prize money ($80091004)
   8008F54C - 4 bytes points to other information ($8008F4E4)
   8008F550 - 4 bytes points to potential car list ($80090B50)
   8008F554 - 4 bytes points to prize car list ($80090D0C)
   8008F558 - 4 bytes points containing number of laps per race (2)
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

Each event appears to have an entry here like this.  While you are
racing, locations $8008C0B0 to $8008C6A8 appear to contain a list
of filenames, nicely aligned on eight-byte boundaries even though
the names are only 5 bytes long, which seem to describe prize and
competitor cars.  Each list of prizes and competitors points into
this list.  Unfortunately, while setting, say, a Spot Race competitor
list to the Grand Valley 300 list does result in names and body types
which race in the GV300, the specs and wheels are not correct, so
soemthing went wrong trying to do it that simply.

The file names for the prize cars can be deduced as follows.
(Shown in the order they occur in memory).

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
+ means confirmed
? less than certain of my guess

$8008C4D0 t-rdn - TRD 3000GT +
$8008C4D8 h-rxn   CRX '91 +
$8008C4E0 dcphn   Concept Car (B license) +
$8008C4E8 n-00r   Nissan 400R * no, this is for entry lists
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

Three of the above four aren't actually prizes, but must be there
for entry lists in races.  I'm not sure why h-rxn is up there separated
from the other prizes below.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>

</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

I later found the following three occurrences of license car strings, and
confirmed them all with an actual code to win those cars for the GT events.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
    8008BD00 n-00n Nissan 400R +
    8008BD08 t-rdn TRD 3000GT +
    8008BD10 dcphn Concept Car (B license) +
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>


First character is clearly:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 a   Mazda
 c   Chevrolet
 d   Dodge
 l   Aston Martin
 m   Mitsubishi
 n   Nissan
 s   Subaru
 t   Toyota
 v   TVR
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

The terminal "n" or "r" refers to "normal" or "race-mod".

The "-" indicates that this is a prize car.  This may relate to why the
Concept Car prize has a value of Cr0 and cannot be sold.

What I usually do to win an alternate prize, using a Game Shark Pro,
is the following:

<HTML INDENT>
<ol>
<li> Enter Sunday Cup</li>
<li> set string at $8008C678 ("a-emn") to a different value</li>
<li> set 4 bytes at $80090E10 to 0 - this makes the Sunday Cup a single race</li>
<li> win race</li>
<li> go see car</li>
</ol>
</HTML>
8-)

In car buying mode there is a list of these sorts of file names from
approximately $800A9482 to $800A9C88.  Among them I spotted

c-67n, cc67n

which are probably the 1967 Corvette Stringray.  However, if you try and
use either of those as a prize you do not win one.  Often when a code
does not work, you win a Toyota Starlet Glanza.  That's because that
car has garage car body code 0.  When trying to get a 1967 Corvette,
however, I won a Glanza with the famous "rainbow" colour scheme.  That
makes me suspect part of the game recognizes the Corvette, and selects
one of its 7 colours, but some other part detects it as an error and
sets the car body value to 0.

You seem to be able to win most car codes which end in "n" as prizes,
but there is a caveat.

texvn - Exiv 200 GT

I won that, in nice dark green, a legitimate colour, and the car had a
value and I was able to sell it.  But...

nr32n

won be a black '91 Skyline, but its value was 0 and I was unable to
sell it--oops.

Attempting to change one file name to another so as to try and buy a
car from a different place does not seem to work.  If the car is
supposed to be a used car, it does not show up in the inventory
at all!

While I patch the extra strings using a GameShark Pro, I will probably
design a code for winning the prize cars ( especially license test cars)
at the Sunday Cup, and I will probably change the pointer which points
to the string "a-emn" to point elsewhere instead, since that will be
shorter.
