Psychology of Gran Turismo, a Modern Video Game

Threads:
  Game Evaluation
  Prize Car Patterns

Newsgroups: rec.games.video.sony

Well, I had quite liked the Gran Turismo Demo in the demo disks which
came with my Playstation, and so, based almost entirely on that, I
decided to buy it.

The racing simulator (using the term loosely) I had most frequently
used most recently prior to that was SuperBike Challenge on the
Commodore 64.  It was a nice little game.  A joystick used in the
obvious fashion, although you needed to "change gears" by pushing the
fire button while leaning the stick forward or back.  You soon learned
the quirks of controlling the bikes with the stick.  Learning the
tracks became a case of remembering the speeds you could corner at,
with a little bit of road positioning.  Gear-changing was useful only
when restarting after a crash.  You could race two players and two AI
bikes, or (as I always did) one player and 3 AI bikes.  Twelve tracks
could be raced as single races, or as a combined season.  I got so I
could very reliably win the season, though I never swept it--I'd
usually make a couple of mistakes.  That took about two hours, and was
a relaxing way to spend an evening.

The graphics were probably not quite up to the 64's potential, but were
adequate.  Secondary scenery was non-existent; a ribbon of grey road
with white-and-red markers slithered quickly towards you from the
horizon, like an agitated serpent.

So, perhaps I did not expect too much more from Gran Turismo.  I mean,
the Arcade mode is similar to the above with all the well-known
improvements--better scenery, realistic vehicle handling, excellently
co-ordinated sounds, etc.  Taking a "new" arcade mode and unlocking
it entirely is now a somewhat amusing way to spend two hours or so.
Granted, it originally took me several days to completely unlock all of
it, but with the training of playing the game a lot, arcade mode now
seems a manageable game.

But then there's simulation mode.  Days (a few real, many simulation)
before I got the "License" I needed just to make a reasonable amount of
money.  But eventually after some absurd late-night (even all-night)
sessions I got the A-license to unlock the most fun elements of the
game.  And a while later I really did get the IA license I had at one
time though unattainable.

So I would race and race and race.  I began winning those prize-cars.
Then I discovered web sites which would tell me exactly which
prize-cars I had yet to obtain.

But somehow, some of those prize cars seemed very elusive.  I noticed
that new prizes from the "specialized Series" (FF, etc.) seemed to
appear when I raced new cars there, especially if I raced those cars
in lots of other races first.  (Sunday, Clubman, and maybe GT cups).

But the International Prize Cars.  It seemed in each series I would get
one of two cars only.  I would keep racing and racing those series,
and, in the back of my mind, I would be hoping to get a new prize car.

Eventually one day I did.  A tuned (not race-modded) GTO'95MR managed
to win JPvsUS, and I got a white Viper with not blue, as had become all
too common, but *green* stripes.  The GTO won the All-Night II I had
been preparing for, and then the Tuned (aka Abnormal) Car Contest, and
then went back to JPvsUS and won a black FTO LM--yet another new prize
car!!!  These extra cars really did exist!

Strange you know.  After that point, I really didn't race JPvsUS much
any more.  I wanted a grey-and-purple Cerbera LM, and a yellow Concept
Car.  But they really did not seem to appear until I consciously
did various things to try and get them.

I bought more cars (at this point I had to save my prize cars in a
separate game, frozen at day 2855 specifically for that purpose), and
raced them as much as possible.  Although I read things which said the
prizes were awarded randomly, it sure seemed to me that cars which had
won more and lost less (in other series) had a better chance of getting
more cars than others did.  The purple ConceptCar, for instance, seemed
to turn up three of four cars in USvsUK.

Yes, eventually, a race-modded Griffith 500, first winning almost
everything it was eligible for (all of GT League, plus FR), turned up
the elusive grey-and-purple Cerbera LM after competing in the
UKvsJP five times.  (Would you believe my garage was full for one
race--whew!).  But it would not get the yellow ConceptCar from UKvsUS.

To get the yellow ConceptCar, I got really desperate, and started a
"second" game.  A prize ConceptCar in that game won a white-and-blue
Viper five times in five USvsJP.  (I entered that car in no other
races, as a deliberate experiment; two other cars entered in a variety
of races (but not GT-I) won a black FTO LM).  A race-modded Viper GTS
which won all of GT League, plus FR, in that game turned it up in three
UKvsUS, although it did not appear to be about to turn it up before
that.  (In a fourth UKvsUS it turned up another yellow ConceptCar--have
you ever heard a PlayStation giggle?)  And soon after that, I followed
a similar routine with the same car in my "main" game, and sure enough,
I got a yellow ConceptCar "legitimately".

The "other colours" of the other two cars in question, the del Sol LM,
and RX7 Aspec LM, both sort of appeared without a lot of conscious
effort.

All right, it became time to complete my collection.  And, you know, I
really have not raced any of the International Series Races very much
since then.

Different cars, with good racing histories, thrown at the various
series with holdouts (FR, Mega) turned the missing cars up relatively
easily.  The two colours of the enduro prizes appeared very easily
without any effort.

This left the two long series, the Normal and the Abnormal (okay, they
call the second "Tuned", but I think 900+bhp mid-class Japanese sports
cars are fairly abnormal).  The prize-cars for these appeared in
better-than-random time, perhaps because I would change the car I
was using to another one which had a reaonably good history (or else
create a history for it).  9 wins for the Normal, and 10 for the
Abnormal.  You think that's not better-than-random?  All right then,
try rolling a die several times and see how long it takes you to
"collect" all six numbers.  Try that experiment several times, and
see how often it usually seems to take you.

Furthermore, to get the last Abnormal prize, I bought my first ever
Viper RT/10 (I had used only the GTS before).  Now, before I
raced in a bunch of other races, it got duplicate prizes, but
after I raced and won with it in A-level GT League, and the FR
Series, it got the remaining car on the first try.

So I got my yellow Skyline, added it to the collection of cars in
the "prize car garage", and got rid of some more of the cars in my
"real" game.

At that point I realized, I would find it somewhat difficult to keep
racing the races with no new prize cars to get.  The knowledge that
there were new cars to get had been a more significant motivating
factor than I had realized.  Sure, I've gone back and won some of the
series with cars I was a little unsure about using in the serious
pursuit of prizes, but, after a little of that it's difficult to
think of interesting things to do.  (Hmm.  Maybe if I win the Normal
with the right car, that mythical '67 Corvette will appear--not likely).

Allegedly, I can now concentrate on getting my license test cars.  But,
as an honest personal self-evaluation, I don't think I have the
consistency of co-ordination for doing that.  And, now, suppose I was
that good.  Well *then* that would make the rest of the game seem
even more pointless, as I would be in even more complete control of
many of the series.  (Presumably).  (Besides, on the weekend I finally
found and bought the GT download CD  8-)   (From Zeller's, for those
who might benefit from that information).

When I was in the middle of all this, I began thinking "There is too
much in Gran Turismo.  Sony is actually marketing a product which
causes consumers to buy fewer other comparable products than they might
otherwise."  (though I did buy a lot of memory cards  8-)).

But now I'm beginning to think that the complexity of the game helps to
create a desire for ever-increasing complexity, and for continually
new rewards.  Whereas I would pick up Superbike Challenge after a
few months break for the pleasure of relearning it, and the simulated
competition, there was never the excitement (okay maybe I have a dull
life) of acquiring new prizes.

That last paragraph is really the reason for this entire rambling post.
I'll probably post it as a separate thread.  8-)

Some GT players might be interested in my personally observed "tricks"
for acquiring the prize cars.  And, FWIW, I do not believe the cars are
awarded randomly with uniform distribution, under the influence of
buggy use of buggy pseudo-random number generators, as is implied in
some FAQs.  In the presence or absence of apparently correlated
actions, the cars appear either more or less often than random.
