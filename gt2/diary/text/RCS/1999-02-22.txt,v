   Even my mother seemed a bit impressed

   I bought PlayStation as a gift for my daugther... she was keen on this
   Spice Girls game. It's a long time to christmas (it was at
   least at purchase date), so I decided to buy a game for myself to play
   until the holy day. The choice fell on Gran Turismo and
   was well worth it. I have played it for "some" hours now, but I still
   struggle with the A-licence... a good thing though since it
   means that you will have challenges for a long time ahead. The
   replay-function is the best thing about the game... incredibly
   fancy. My girlfriend tried it... and she is as hooked as me. Her female
   friends thought it was hilarious. Our neighbours
   "borrowed" it for some days and almost refused to give it back........ need
   I say more?

When I'm bored I take semi-random, usually unmodified, cars and try and
win the Sunday Cup.  Usually you can win if you don't make gross
mistakes.  It took me two tries to win with the Camaro anniversary
special.  First time I got 3+9+9 to 9+6+6 and it gave the win to the AI
car.  Grrr!!!  So I tried again and won.  That's one car where you
might as well pick "AT" over "MT".  It never even gets into fourth
gear, not even at Grand Valley!!
