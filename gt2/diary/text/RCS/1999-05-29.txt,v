I finally used "another" game to win the yellow Concept Car!

Threads:
  Prize Car Patterns

I took a game saved at day 60 with test A1 to A7 done, but A8 not.

   Day(s)           Car         Event                Prize Car
   ------           ---         -----                ----- ---
  60-64                 A-8 completed
     purchased Silvia K's and won Sunday Cup and sold Demios
     bought Griffith 500 ASAP, did non-permanent tune
     won all open GTL events, and FR and all Spot Races
     Then I race-modded it for the International Serieses.
     From now on, I kept almost all prize cars from now on.
