Perl script to verify car data

Based on mail to Nick.

Threads:
  Car Information

In the data for http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/cgi-bin/sim-cars.cgi
there seem to be some inconsistencies.

I used:

#!/bin/csh -f
lynx -source http://www.ent.ohiou.edu/~albrnick/gt/cgi-bin/sim-cars.cgi -post_data <<EOF
show=manu&show=cdt&show=cshp&show=csw&show=csr&show=cmhp&show=cmw&show=cmr&num_cars=1000&order=0&key=cshp&test1=none&min1=&max1=&test2=none&min2=&max2=&Toyota=-1&Mitsubishi=-1&Aston+Martin=-1&Nissan=-1&Honda%2FAcura=-1&Dodge=-1&Subaru=-1&Chevrolet=-1&TVR=-1&Mazda=-1&Prize+Cars=-1
EOF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to dump data for all the cars, I believe.  I then edited it into
"lotus form", sort of.

I then ran it through the following Perl script:

#!/xhbin/perl5
while ( <> ) {
	$_ =~ s/\n//g;
	@@original = split(/,/);
	@@fields = @@original;
	foreach $f (@@fields) {
		if ( $f =~ /---/) {
			$f = -1;
		}
	}
# printf ( "%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s\n", (@@fields) );
# print $#fields, ",";
	($name,$mfr,$drive,$stockbhp,$stocklb,$stockrat,$maxbhp,$maxlb,$maxrat) =
		 @@fields;
	$alert1 = "";
	$alert2 = "";
	$gsrat = $stockbhp / $stocklb;
	if ( $stocklb > 0 && abs( $gsrat - $stockrat ) > .001 ) {
		$alert1 = sprintf(",** stock ratio ** $stockrat should be %0.3f", $gsrat);
	}
	$gmrat = $maxbhp / $maxlb;
	if ( $maxlb > 0 && abs( $gmrat - $maxrat ) > .001 ) {
		$alert2 = sprintf(",** maxed ratio ** $maxrat should be %0.3f", $gmrat );
	}
		
	printf("%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s", (@@original) );
	printf("%s%s\n", $alert1,$alert2 );
}
