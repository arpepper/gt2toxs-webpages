So, I led from start to finish again.  The first two cars were lapped by
lap eight, and the whole field was lapped by the 2nd pit stop.

The lap times slowed down slightly towards the end of the race.

You can see there was an absurdly close race for second, which I 
could see the couple of times I passed them on the road (the first
lapping happened while they were in the pits).

The second place times were moderately slow, perhaps because of
competition/interference.

Note, this car is somewhate hard on tires, and penalty for stops
is slight, so 6 or even 7 stops (of necessity uneven) might work
slightly better.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

All-in-all I was disappointed that I didn't take even 30 seconds off
my previous time.

But this car was so good I'll try the tuned version next.
