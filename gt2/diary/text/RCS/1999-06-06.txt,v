Winning the Tuned ("Abnormal") Car Contest a few more times?

Anyway, I managed to win the Abnormal Car Contest three times last
weekend, out of three attempts.  Twice with the GTO'95MR, and once with
a more recent GTO twinturbo I happened to have lying aroung.
(Actually, I tried it first, way back when, but I was not good enough,
so I tried the GTO'95MR, since it is the very lightest, so I went back
on the weekend to prove I had improved).

Thread: Driving Advice

So I ought to have more helpful advice about it.

Feeling comfortable with Clubman R5ii seems key to both Normal and
Abnormal Contests.  You've got to know when to throw yourself into
the first corner so you have lots of margin for error, and won't
get caught by "the trap".  In the Normal Contest (lost once last
weekend by Griffith 500, then won by it, then won by Griffith 4.0),
I once sent the Griffith 4.0 into that corner so hard, though, it
spun right around.  No problem, I was so far ahead the AI cars did
not even catch me.  8-)  I did sort of the same thing with the GTO
twinturbo at least once, but the four-wheel drive meant I did not
go right around, but just ended up skidding along facing into the
corner, and lost only a little time.  In both Normal and Abnomal
contests, I pretty much "sacrifice" the second-last event (Deep
Forest Racing Way ii in Normal, Autumn Ring ii in Abnormal) although
I am getting better (less worse) at both of them.  In both Clubman
and SSR11, you've got to just give up any idea of completely avoiding
the walls; just quickly recover, and even use them to your advantage.

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

So now I've got all six prize cars from the Normal, and three from
the Abnormal (the GTO'95MR won the blue Trueno twice, and the GTO
twinturbo finally won a '91 Skyline--blue; I won the white Trueno
quite a long time ago).

Thread: Tuning Advice

For both GTO's I use 906hp = Turbo Spec 4 plus racing intercooler and
semi-racing exhaust, and 1.2 camber, front and rear, and 12F/9R
brakes.  I use 4.2 final drive, but don't recall or have notes about
what the top gear ratio is; something under .800, I think.  4/4
stabilizer, I *think*.  I think the springs and damper are left stock.
In the best Autumn Ring ii finish, I changed the intercooler to normal,
and changed the final drive to 4.5, for that one race only.

Although the lowish camber, identical front and rear, combined with the
excessive power and high-speed torque, makes the car very slippery, it
seems, probably because of the identical camber settings, to be very
predictable in its wild motions.

Apart from the license test cars, the only prize cars I have left to get
are the three remaining from the Abnormal Car Contest.  At least now I
am comfortable enough with that series to play it with my wife and the
television beside me.

I'm even contemplating attacking the Abnormal series with a tuned
Cerbera tonight.   8-)
