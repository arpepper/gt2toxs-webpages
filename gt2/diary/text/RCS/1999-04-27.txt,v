Thoughts About Acquiring Particular Prize Cars in International Series

Threads:
  Prize Car Patterns

Based on email to Dave.

Previously I never saw a black del Sol.  Now I see them regularly.

If I take a "new" car, win UKvsJP three times in succession, I will
nearly always win green Cerbera, red del Sol, black del Sol, in that
order.  After that, it will be stuck on green Cerberas.

It's like something "unlocks" a prize car to become available.  The
most recent ones appeared, I believe, when I used a tuned car to win
USvsJP and UKvsJP.  Varieties of cars might be LM(prize), race-mods
and tuned.  Perhaps it counts nationalities.  I've used race-modded
cars of all three nationalities to win the two appropriate series
pf the three.  Similarly, I've used the different nationality
LM cars to win their appropriate series.  Perhaps I won't get my
fourth USvsUK and UKvsJP prize cars until I win with American
and British tuned cars.

On the other hand, the green FTO was one of the early cars I won.  But
that is not the case with some people.

That suggests that the order in which prize cars become unlocked might
be semi-random.  Perhaps it depends upon the day number on which you
complete various license tests, or perhaps the state of your "race
trophy" collection.

Perhaps it depends upon a machine-readable serial number in your
PlayStation.  8-)

Well, four successive wins with a new car in USvsJP isn't sufficient to
win all four prize cars.  Since the dreaded RX-7 Aspec LM is next up
for GV300 evaluation, I raced it, which meant my results were less than
perfect.  Although I always won JPvsUS, I lost Trial Mountain ii a
couple of times, and missed a couple of poles.  I always won "cleanly"
(ie with 4+ wins, and no reliance on shenanigans from other cars
exchanging places).

I won, in order:
   green FTO LM
   black FTO LM
   green FTO LM  (this seemed peculiar)
   white/blue Viper GTS-R
   white/blue Viper GTS-R
   white/blue Viper GTS-R

So, although I did recently win the white/green Viper, I did not win it
in this set.  But I did win a couple of green FTO LM's (sorry!).

And I did win the black FTO LM, which up until recently I had never
seen.  It now seems quite "common".

So I suspect when someone failed to win the green FTO LM, they probably
got the game into a state where their set of three cars to win was
{black FTO LM,white/blue Viper GTS-R,white/green Viper GTS-R}.  This is
strange.

Another thing, according to my notes, when I won the white/green Viper
I did so when the tuned '95 GTO MR won the series 45 to 22.  Now the
points awarded to the second-place car is a difficult thing to control,
especially with the way that Subaru zips off into the lead every time
(although the MR can keep up; sub-theme of game; 4wd is superior).  In
fact, the '95 GTO MR career went:

  UKvsJP  45to??  green Cerbera
  UKvsJP  45to??  black del Sol
  USvsJP  45to22  white/green Viper (first and, so far, only)
  USvsJP  45to27  green FTO LM
  SSR11ii  won
  USvsJP  40to28  black FTO LM (first time for that car for me!)

Now, in general it seems that as you enter a series with the same car
more and more times, fewer exchanges of points take place by the other
competitors.  So you eventually end up winning 45 to 30 all the time.
Perhaps the car awarded depends upon the second place points total,
although I have got both green FTO and white/blue Viper for 45
to 30.  So perhaps there's a random aspect too.  (vigorous
handwaving).  Not to mention the points that got me me first black
FTO above, versus the green one.  (And then there's the speculation
that the assignment of prize cars to whatever triggers are involved
differs from game to game for some reason).

Of course, the annoying thing about this is that someone somewhere must
know how the cars are awarded!!!  (I.e. programmers at Polyphony).

Deliberately arranging to make the second place car get 22 points or
less would be quite difficult.
