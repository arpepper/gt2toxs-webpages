More success!

Based on mail to Nick.

I'll try to keep this brief.  8-)

Finished all Normal and got the Credits yesterday!
So I guess I shouldn't give up.  8-)
Trial Mountain "C" was the last "normal" I got.
Lots of subtle places on that course to wring speed out of the Civic.
Game doesn't let you save the replay of the win, because it goes
straight to the credits then back to the menu.  8-(   8-)

Done some Difficult.  A-B-C on High Speed Ring and Clubman R5. And a
couple of others "A" only (where Viper works well  8-) I finally
realized that position relative to #1 is more important at all times
than your position #.  E.g. expecially on Arcade Grand Valley full
circuit where that HUGE bump before second hairpin means other cars are
likely to knock you out of control.  At "normal" level, at least,
deliberately staying behind (or fifth) before each navigation of that
bump seemed to help.  Computer cars seem to be expert jumpers.

Impreza in general seems urealistically easy to control.

Oh.  And I finally completed A-3.  Using automatic. 8-( Qualified
by only .006 seconds; closest I came without qualifying was .008
over.  Don't know whether my skill level will ever get to where
cost/benefit analysis would justify drifting all such corners
habitually, although the exercise has probably reduced my time
for that stretch by 3 seconds even without totally drifting the
corner.

Thread: Driving Advice

Handbrake helps all starts with engines with low low-speed torque,
e.g. for a second practice run where they don't operate your "clutch"
for you, or if you spin to a stop anywhere, not just up hills.

Like two identical purchased cars, two identical prizes can share parts
(e.g. two Demios  8-), but a prize, e.g. Civic(Racer) cannot share
parts with a purchased Civic(Racer).

But Gran Turismo knows that you need to purchase separate e.g. port
polishing and weight reduction for each, and allows it.
