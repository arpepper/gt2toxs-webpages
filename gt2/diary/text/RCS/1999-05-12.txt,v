Turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, G-T-O at Grand Valley 300KM

The [R]GTO'95 LM looked poised to beat out all previous cars except
for the Concept Car, and that's exactly what it did.

First, a relatively uneventful warm-up at the 4WD Challenge:

   SSR5ii  q1st 1:15.162not  1st 2.25.686not  fl 1:11.772not

Then the main event of the evening:

   [R]GTO'95 MR

   q1st 1:42.430not     Cr20,000

This was a disappointingly weak field for this car to challenge.

I blew my qualifying time, coming off between the two hairpins
when trying to go just a little too fast.  I should have been
able to set a new qualifying record.   8-(  Luckily the car
had so much in reserve that I still managed to get pole position.

With the clean start I got, however, it would not have made much
difference.  This race I led literally from start to finish.

I had about three disasters in the race, often when overtaking
other cars.  8-(

Near the end of the race, the car became difficult to control, to
the point that I began wondering if my controller was going flakey.

I was encourage early in the race by the several 1:32.xxx laps, but
that turned out to be a strong start, and I was not quite able to
match that performance later in the race.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.

Apart from it getting difficult to control near the end, I liked this
car so much I'm going to give it another try to see if the recent
experience can result in a better time.

Immediately after the race, I went to the 4wd series, and broke
8 of 9 available records.  That seems to suggest my controller is
still working fine.  (The remaining record I had set earlier
in the evening  8-).

I was very cavalier about wall-bouncing around SSR5ii, and in
the process discovered that there is actually a "sticky bit",
on the inside of the esse which takes you on to the common
Clubman portion.

So here's the PB-setting results from that cool-down series:
