But I buy cars from myself in Gran Turismo all the time...

Threads:
  Prize Car Information
  Used Car Patterns

Those LM prize cars are a real bargain at only Cr35000.  That way I can
have one to leave stock, and one to mess up with my fiddling.  I don't
trust those stupid "settings" files, besides you can't just read them.

I wonder.  Is it ethical to artificially run a GT game up to day 60 to
buy a bargain, and sell that back to a day 1 game?  Oh well, you can
always get an MA70 Supra for < Cr8000 and that's the only car you
need to get the game rolling, since (modified) it can win the GT Cup.

See, I'm co-operative with a slightly devious mind.

Oh, you might want to pay a little more than Cr8000 to get a red one,
since red cars are always the best.  8-)
