Compact form of braking force ratio chart

Threads:
  Brake Balance Controller

The following chart gives % of braking force on the front as a function of
the two settings.

                                        Rear
  F     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15
  1:  50.0 33.3 25.0 20.0 16.7 14.3 12.5 11.1 10.0  9.1  8.3  7.7  7.1  6.7  6.2

 10:  90.9 83.3 76.9 71.4 66.7 62.5 58.8 55.6 52.6 50.0 47.6 45.5 43.5 41.7 40.0
 11:  91.7 84.6 78.6 73.3 68.8 64.7 61.1 57.9 55.0 52.4 50.0 47.8 45.8 44.0 42.3

One can visually scan this chart, starting from the ratio one has, looking
for close values in either direction.  In addition, one should look for
an identical or close ratio to the starting value, and search around there.
 
A good enhancement would be to show the chart in shades of a colour,
with darkness of the shade corresponding to the size of the number.

Someone good at using a slide rule should be able to accomplish much
this same effect with a slide rule.  I thought I'd seen a page on the web
explaining that, but Alta Vista finds no matches for +gran +turismo
+"slide rule" (nor if I say "sliderule", nor "slide-rule").  Looking
for +gran +turismo +slide +rule finds 17 pages, and the ones I've
looked at are using "rule" and "slide" separately.

Of course, someone good at using a slide rule might be really good with
ratios, too, and be able to know that the next highest ratio after
10/7, using the integers 1..15 is 13/9...


Adrian.

The perl script for this table is really dinky.

#!/xhbin/perl5 -w

printf("%44s\n","Rear");
printf(" F ");
for ($r = 1; $r <= 15; ++$r) {
        printf("%5d", $r );
}
printf("\n");
for ( $f = 1; $f <= 15; ++$f) {
        printf("%2d: ",$f);
        for ($r = 1; $r <= 15; ++$r) {
                printf("%5.1f", $f * 100.0  / ($f + $r));
        }
        printf("\n");
}
