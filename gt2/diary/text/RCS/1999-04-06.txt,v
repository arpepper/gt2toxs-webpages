Minor nitpick about tire wear in enduros

Thread: Driving Advice

So, in the GV300, etc, blue tires are cold, right?  Not quite as much
traction as warmed-up green ones.  But better than yellow or red ones.
Right?

Well, I think GT should make you should qualify on your tires in the
last state your test run had left them in.  That way you could warm
them up to what you think is the optimal state.  Instead, you always
qualify on "blue" tires.

I think the trickiest thing about the enduros is learning to use your
regained traction after changing tires, since you will have adapted
your driving to their pre-pit worn state.  It's especially tricky since
you must first go through the "blue" lap where you still don't quite
have full traction.  That's my excuse for coming second the first time
I tried in a Cerbera LM, anyway.

Most players have probably already discovered how to practise the pit
exit during test runs; you would think pitting in would let you, but it
does not--you start your next test run from the starting line.  If,
however, you drive the wrong way up the pit exit during a test run,
then when you reach the "zone" the computer will take over, do a
three-point turn to turn your car around the right way, and then go
through the "Get Ready... Rev Up! ...  Go!" sequence.  If you drive
into the exit immediately after the start of a new test run, you will
get to practise the first set of corners on pretty close to totally
blue tires, pretty much the way it will be after each pit stop.  This
obviously does mess up your lap timing, however.

I wonder how much under 1 hour 30 minutes the world record for GV300 is?
