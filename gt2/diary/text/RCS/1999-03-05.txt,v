The Toyota Starlet Glanza

Last night I decided to play my "real" game, and bought a (two,
actually) new Toyota Starlet Glanzas.  I kept one stock, and maxed the
other.  As usual, the stock one won the Sunday Cup with a little bit of
difficulty, while the maxed one could sweep it easily, including
poles.  In between, I had entered the car in the Lightweight "Battle
Stage" and done fairly badly.  I got badly pipped at the post on Autumn
Ring-Mini II, but won at Clubman R5.  But then I got flustered near the
end of Deep Forest.  The cars in this series seem to race easy at the
start, and then get meaner towards the end of each race.  I seemed to
be in total control of Deep Forest half-way through lap 2, but then,
coming down the big hill I went too deep into the turn after it and the
Demio went by and after that I was no longer in control.  I did
something really strange at the final near-haipin, perhaps because I
was not used to the car, ending up losing a lot of time by cutting
across the inside grass.

Thread: Used Car Patterns

I decided to take inventory of day 1620, since perhaps the large number
days will be useful for determining patterns.  But actually, I suspect
each day the game just takes the day number (or the nearest multiple of
10, or the day number divided by 10), and uses it to seed some sort of
pseudo-random number generator.  Each car presumably has a probability
of appearing, and a probabilistic price range.  There will be a pattern,
but it might be a very long one, and part of determining the pattern
might depend upon determining the order in which the display and
price decisions are made.

Nevertheless, I think my daily inventory might be useful, so I will
try and enter it up to at least day 250.
