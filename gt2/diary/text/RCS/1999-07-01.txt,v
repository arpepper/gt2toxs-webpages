I've been on Holiday for a While

Threads:
  Prize Car Patterns

I've been on holiday for a while, playing lots of Gran Turismo, but
not finding a lot of opportunity to add new diary entries.

I started a new game to try and get all prize cars, and it is
now at about day 850 and I have one colour of all models of
race prize cars, and have kept a fairly detailed log of the
game progress, including series results and prize cars won.

I have only Megaspeed, 4wd, Tuned and the two Enduros to finish
up, but that could all take quite a while!

I'll probably fill in entries for days between June 20th and July 1st
later if I get a chance.
