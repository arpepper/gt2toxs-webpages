Brief Exciting Enduro Results in Gran Turismo 2

  Gran Turismo 2

I'm not very good, so here's how I did in the Rome Two Hours.

==>1. [R]Concept Car LM Edition      2-00:09.0       (87 laps completed)
   2. [R]Venturi Atlantique 600LM       +8.227  (2-00:17.2)
   3. [R]Toyota GT ONE'99              +16.599  (2-00:25.6)
   4. [R]Nissan R390 GT1 '97         +1:10.383  (2-01:19.4)
   5. [R]STP Taiser Viper GT            +6.369  (2-00:15.4)
   6. Jaguar XJ220 GT Race Car           2laps

As you can imagine, it was a lot of tense fun, especially since I
spun on lap two and was coming from behind most of the races.
Pit stops 10,27,45,62,79 (soft/soft slicks).  I spun on lap 79, too
meaning I lost the lead on the last stop, too, but the GT-ONE
pitted soon after that.  And I really didn't realize the Venturi
was so close.  8-)

You though that was close?

I drove the Monte Carlo Mini in the Seattle 100.


==>1. [R]Rover Mini 1275S MarkI      1-09:48.5
   2. Mustang SVT Cobra '98             +0.847  (1-09:49.3)
   3. Shelby GT350 '66                 +33.268  (1-10:21.8)
   4. Plymouth Superbird             +2:44.109  (1-12:32.6)
   5. Plymouth 'Cuda '70             +3:13.335  (1-13:01.8)
   6. Plymouth GTX                   +5:38.154  (1-15:26.7)

Two pit stops, at 14 and 27 of 40 laps.

Almost makes me believe there is a handicap algorithm in the Enduro
races.   8-)   There didn't seem to be one in GT1.  I raced the GV300
49 times, and I both won and lost when the NSX-R LM GT2 managed
1-41:50, and each model of AI car seemed to finish at very close to
some time particular to the model.

In the above Seattle race, I was a solid third until the AI cars
pitted, after which I alternated first and second depending upon the
pit situation, gaining the lead when the Mustang pitted on lap 34.

I missed a gear change on lap 38, costing me two seconds.  (I was
a gear down from where I thought I was going into the near-hairpin
in the centre of the course).  That had the Mustang nipping at my
heels, and I had to be forceful with it on the last two laps.  8-)

I'll try with a metallic raspberry '70 'Cuda next, because my Dad used
to own a Valiant.   8-)  It seems to be able to go just a shade faster
than the Mini.

Interesting that one AI non-muscle car seems to usually show up for the
race.  In the preview I watched, there was a Griffith 500 lapping at
about 1:44 (according to my stopwatch), but the Mustang managed faster
than that, I'm sure.
