More Demio Racing

Well, I guess I got bored today.

Thread: Tuning Advice

I put together a max-tuned Demio (weight reduction 3).  I used
all the most expensive parts, except for no ("normal") rear
stabilizer.  Sometimes I used a normal flywheel, too, but it
does not seem critical to do that with this car.  Even at
Deep Forest Racing Way ii, it seems to be able to climb the hills
without noticeable speed loss with the racing flywheel.

Numbers were:

Spring Rate         2.4    2.2
Ride Height         100    100
Dampers              1      1
Camber              2.0    1.0
Stabilizers          1      0
Brake Balance       12      9

Turbo                    6
   Although I did fit racing support, I went with the stock gear
settings, since they are nicely spaced out.

It took me a while to realize this car is more sensitive than some to
ride height.  It's as if the weight reduction is simulated so as to
leave most of the remaining weight somewhat high up.  Fortunately,
it does not seem to give any strange penalties for lowering
ride height (excessively bumpy ride, or excessive sliding with
no warning), and minimum ride height works very well for it.
Along with soft, independent, suspension to keep all four wheels
on the ground (most of the time).   (I might actually go with
softer suspension, but you need non-stock to lower the ride
height, and that means you can't set dampers less than 1.  Now,
one very important thing in GT is to balance springs and dampers,
especially with light cars, so I sort of raised the springs to
match the damping force).

Thread: Race Results

In the above form, the car was able to sweep all events and poles
at both the FF Challenge and the Lightweight Battle Stage, beating
a Civic3dr'93si in both cases.

After that, I took my race-modded Demio, gave it identical settings
(except for, by chance old 15/12 brake controller settings), plus
maximum aero.  That car swept both those events, and set a few
personal best times in the process.  (Actually, due to over-enthusiam
on the last corner, I came 2nd at DFRWii the first time through
the FF Challenge; I still massacred the tuned version time, but
you know how Gran Turismo is... 8-)  I guess I should take
something like an FTO GPversionR back to those events, now 
that I've learned some of the courses better, courtesy of the
Normal and Abnormal series.

Following that, I swept all poles and events in the Clubman Cup
with the race-modded Demio.   After that I entered it in the
GT Cup, and, somewhat to my surprise, won all four events.
(I qualified a "solid" sixth in all events, ie 6th, but only about 2
seconds behind the leader in most cases, as opposed to a "distant
sixth").

Gears for the race-modded version are different:

   4.400
   2.000
   1.400
   1.056
   0.872
   -----
   3.600

That's how I found them in my garage, and they seemed okay, and so I
kept them like that.

So, given the price (free) this car is reasonably worth-while.

You could say it's a "Great Little Car", but, actually, that was
a different model Mazda.   8-)
