<CODES>
I've always wanted to do an Enduro at the High Speed Ring, and now,
thanks to <b>PotHole</b>, I've managed to do it.

I chose my trusty 1994 Subaru Impreza Wagon WRX as a possible compromise
between way too each, and a little too challenging for my first test.
Perhaps it was a little too easy, actually.

I dropped behind the Twinturbo for half a lap, but then I got by at
the esses, and that was that.

I lapped the Lantis very soon, on lap 8.


I was in the process of lapping the field by my first stop (although
the Supra was still a little way ahead, albeit a lap down, at that point).
Eventually I lapped the entire field once.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

Once again I actually recorded all lap times, as follows:

Lucky you!    8-)

An exact match for the total again!


I didn't note my settings this time.  They were probably the same as
they were for the last Enduro I did with this car.
