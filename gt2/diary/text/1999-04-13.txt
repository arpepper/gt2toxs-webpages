Thread: Grand Valley 300 Results

Well, I practised a bit last week, and on the weekend won GV300 in
Cerbera LM in 1-38.03.8  (N.B. Nick, me, and I think others, did not
realize that "8 means 8/10ths of a second, not .008 seconds with leading
zero problems  8-) ).  I'm not sure what went wrong on my first try.  I
think there was a "rabbit" car (ie starting "too fast" and perhaps
taking too many pit stops) the first time, which did not seem to be
there the second time.  A GTO or RX7 or something, I think.

I lapped all the other cars at least once.

Thread: All-Night I Results

I did Thirty Laps of Hell I, and won by cheating with the Concept Car.  8-)
54:19.364; I lapped first three, and lapped last two twice, I believe.  My
wife likes the "froggy green" Silvia.  8-)  (Apart from that, I seem to have
won a lot of yellow cars recently; strange the apparent cycles).

Thread: Special Model Information

So I went back and won GV300 with the special Impreza, taking 1-40:24.9,
which still won by 102.849, i.e. more than a lap (just).  I learned this
time that if you wait long enough, all the cars *do* seem to report home
eventually:

1 Impreza RLY Edition   1-40:24.9<---
2 NSX-R LM GT2           +102.849  (1-42:07.7)
3 R32GT-R'91             +119.924  (1-42:24.8)
4 Celica GT-FOUR         +330.667  (1-45:55.6)
5 Lancer EvolV GSR       +357.438  (1-46:22.3)
6 Lantis Type R          +466.386  (1-48:11.3)

so I might have lapped the Lantis four times?  It sure did seem like a
lot, but all three of the last six cars were white with splashy
colours, making them difficult to tell apart.  This time I was fairly
certain no-one ever passed me in the pits; something worth keeping track
of.  The 2nd and 3rd place cars tried to stay unlapped.  That was sort
of fun.   8-)  Especially since my lap times generally drop throughout
the race.  Fastest lap was lap 2  8-)

Pits in both GV300 races were 11,24,36,48  (11 by mistake both times!!!).

Thread: All-Night II Results

Don't ask me about SSR11 All-night II, raced with a Cerbera, though.  8-)

1. Supra RZ             59:01.577
2. FDRX7 Type RZ           +2.157
3. NSX'93                  +8.957
4. LANCER EvolIII GSR     +46.373
5. R33GT-R Vspec          +56.516
6. Cerbera               +193.182<---

That gets you Cr 10,000.

fl lap 20 1:56.223
pits 9,16,23--won't quite manage 10 and 20
