Thoughts about the Mitsubishi GTO TwinTurbo, when tuned.

Last night, having decided the Supra was beyond me, I decided to go the
Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo route, and this seems a little more
promising.  While most of my cars are red, I decided to make this
one blue.  That's because I've been collecting ghost replays of
Grand Valley East II.  I think I like that best as a test track.
The advantage over Grand Valley East I is that you get that fast
corner after the starting straight where you have to learn to brake
and drift the car properly.  You get the hairpin going the other way,
and the tests are much shorter than the full Grand Valley II.
Anyway, if you load an old ghost replay it's nice to have it a
different colour for different cars.  The Cerbera is green, the
Supra gold, the Skyline red, and now the GTO blue.

Well, warming up in the Clubman and 4WD series I did okay.  My max
speed runs were disappointing, managing only 252mph.  400m is
reasonable.  In general, the engine is much more lively than the Supra,
and the car seems manageable, just about, on circuits even at 900+
bhp.  I tried an SSR11 time trial which was very disappointing though.
On the Clubman R5 circuit in the Clubman Cup series, however, it seemed
that the car was capable of breaking my records (which were probably
set by a Cerbera LM, or some other [R] car), but I did not practice
before qualifying.

A big disappointed was the Mega Speed Series.  Without aerodynamics,
the GTO seems really twitchy.  I actually lost one series pretty badly,
then won another (4th-1st-1st) with a bit of help.  To be fair to
myself, I should have been able to win the first race of the second
series but I had accidentally tweaked my final drive in the wrong
direction.  (twit!).

All-in-all, I might have a fighting chance in the tuned car series
with this car.
