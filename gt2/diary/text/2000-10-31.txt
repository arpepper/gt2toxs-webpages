In Simulation Race mode, you can track down the competitors in
the event structures.   Here is the Normal Series.

Now you can't use the <b>GS Pro</b> memory editor to patch these
because by then it is too late.

But you can create a boot code to change some of those values.

When you do that, it is easiest to change the pointers.

For instance, I created a code.

This replaced the NSX with the FD RX-7, and the TRD 3000GT with the
Subaru Impreza.  However, I'm such a rotten driver, I still lost again
the resulting field (which included two RX-7's) when I entered a Lancer
Evolution IV GSR.   8-(   I won the first three races easily, but
got completely destroyed on the third, coming sixth, and then finished
third in the last race.  I first-lap accident put me behind, and I
couldn't catch the two RX-7's, but I think I was falling behind them,
and they finished further ahead of me than the accident itself would
account for.

Note that you cannot set entrant cars to be things which the game
does not expect for that event.  If, for instance, you arrange
that the NSX is replaced by a Viper GTS, you get a strange, 174
bhp FF Viper GTS weighing about 1700 pounds.  A refugee from the
FF or Lightweight Series, I think, as the game gets mixed up.  The
wheels are the wrong size; the car looks sort of like a Honda CRX
or something running around with a Viper body shell mounted on
top of it!  8-)
