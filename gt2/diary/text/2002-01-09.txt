Fun With A Game Shark and Ducati World Racing Challenge

Last night I had fun with a <B>GameShark Pro</B> and <B>Ducati World Racing
Challenge</B>.

I've found the event description structures, so I managed to run races
on different tracks, with different lengths and entrants. Your
entrance requirements seems tied to the AI entrant list, however, so
no over-powering them that way. I also won a lot of money for a single
race. I can patch different bikes into the Vintage lot or the 1-player
challenges, but haven't quite convinced myself I don't create bad
garage structures that way sometimes. Patch the length of the 1-player
challenge to 0 laps and you'll nearly always win. A challenge only
seems to be accepted if the horsepower of the challenge bike is
greater than or equal to yours. At least, I think that's how it works.
In general, the bikes codes are in order of viability (oldest to
newest, basically; same order as the QuickRace menus) but not
entirely.

I'll eventually probably get around to posting some details here
to allow others to do similar stuff.

No hybrids in <B>DWRC</B>. The modifications are indicated by a single bit
only, with the meaning of those modifications being dependent upon the
value (code) of the bike itself. Garage entries are only 32 bytes
long, so you wonder why you're only allowed 5 of them.
