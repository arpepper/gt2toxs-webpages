Impreza Rally Edition Shatters Its Old Record at the Grand Valley 300

Continuing in the Impreza theme, I had been sweeping the GT-I Cup for a
couple of days with the Impreza Rally Edition, in preparation for
allowing it to set an even better time than previously at Grand Valley
300.

It finished 47 seconds faster than the Impreza Wagon the other day and
almost 15 seconds faster than my first attempt with a race-modded
GTO'95MR.  This was over 4 minutes faster than my first attempt with
this car.

I led right from the start, right off the finish line, and right
through a clean first lap.

I lapped my first car at lap 8, and the first 3 by lap 12 (dropping
back with the pit stop).  I had lapped the field for the first time
by lap 15.

One peculiar thing was I never passed the GT-R on the road!
(It was always in the pits).  One time I was coming up to pass
it, entering the main straight, and it ducked into the pits
right then!

Most laps were 1:33's and 1:34's, shifting to more 1:35's towards the
end.  My slowest laps were thanks to our new kitten who decided it
might be fun to play with my wiggling fingers which I was holding at a
convenient height, resting my elbows on my thighs while seated.

I used 4 pit stops (every 12 laps).  Laps 9, 10 and 11 of a shift
seemed slightly slower than others, but I still did not exceed 1:36
very often.

The 1:38.530 slowest lap was actually the last, so tires might have
contributed as well as the kitten (as well as that "safely cruising in"
feeling you get on the last lap of GV300; the crowd cheering, and all
that).

Note that there was no AI Impreza competing.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/green Castrol Supra GT.
