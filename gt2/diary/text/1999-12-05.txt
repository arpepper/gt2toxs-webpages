Well, I was fairly sure in my <html><a href="logs/hastings">hastings</a></html>
game that the Supra RZ could win the All-Night II race.  It had already
won the Mega-Speed Event, and, cleanly, though not comfortably, won
the Tuned Car Series.

One thing I had done at the end of the Tuned Car Series was switch from
Turbo Spec 4 to Turbo Spec 3.   This made handling a lot more natural,
and improve the speed of recoveries after accidents, but did reduce top
speed.

This prize Supra did a reliable job of winning the All-nightII.

Wow, that was very slow.  I did not even lap the field.  Nonetheless,
I did feel in control of the race the entire time, although I did
lose control of the car too many times to count.

I basically led from start to finish.  When I exited my first pit stop,
I had to jostle to keep the lead, losing it momentarily, but continued
on to set fastest lap on the next lap.

The rest of the three stops were uneventful.

I won Cr150,000, and the silver Nismo GT-R LM.

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...

Thread: Gameplay Hints

This car is adequate for winning both the Tuned Series, and this
All-night II race.  Fitted with Turbo Spec 4, it is almost
outstanding in the Mega-Speed Event, however.

Once again I decided to start with the Chaser LM in the UKvsJP Series
(it usually seems easier than the USvsJP Series).  This time I won
my favourite car, the Cerbera LM!  8-)  I nearly swept the series,
qualifying second at the High Speed Ring, and also second at
Special Stage R11.

The Chaser LM does need patience, care, practise, and a little tuning
in order to be able to win that series.  I used its setting from the
<html><a href="1999-09-18.html#Tuning_Advice">Grand Valley 300</a></html>,
but used stabilizers of 3/3 instead of 4/4.

The Cerbera LM handily swept the USvsUK Series--I thought I might win
the RX7 Aspec LM and consider entering that in the USvsJP, but
instead I won the Concept Car.

I wanted to reacquaint myself with the Cerbera LM, and so I entered
it in the GT-I Cup, and swept the series completely, against an
NSX-R LM GT2, a GT-R LM, and also a Lancer Evo IV GSR.  Those
three cars traded positions, and so I won very handily 54 to 29.

I will probably enter the Cerbera LM in the All-Night I and the
Grand Valley 300, to see how well I can do with it now, and then
take the Japanese Prize Car I feel happiest about and enter the
USvsJP.  If I win the FTO LM in that series, I will enter it in
the 4WD Series.  If not, I will need to purchase one more car.  8-(
(The real problem is I did not win a Skyline in the Tuned Series...)
