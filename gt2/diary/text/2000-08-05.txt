(GT2 Version 1.2)  GameShark Code to Set Up Silly Fake Drag Racing

Threads:

On Thursday night I also did the work to create the drag racing
code for Version 1.2

This code arranges that whenever you attempt to enter any race in
Simulation Mode at any Seattle course (or any other course beginning
"Se"--I don't think there are any), the race gets hijacked to the
Max Speed Test course for a 1000m "drag race".

The Max Speed Test track has the property that the start line is
1000m away from the finish line.  So, if you start on lap 1 of a
lap 1 race, you will be done as soon as you cross the finish line,
but that finish line is actually a full 1000m away.

Unfortunately, the cars are not lined up evenly for the start.  I
have put you on grid spot 3, and the AI car in grid spot 2.  If
I put the AI car in grid spot 1, it will move across in front of
or behind you, and spoil the drag race effect, and so therefore
I used spots 2 and 3 since usually the AI can benefit from a
slight head start.  8-)

Notes:
C01D587C 6553 -- Does no codes unless track name starts "Se"
The first "global condition" can be set to anything you think is
appropriate.  Another reasonable thing might be to do this drag
race thing if the track name is "Te".  The way I have it here, however,
"Se" causes Seattle races, which often include Muscle Cars in the
Field, to be hijacked to the Max Speed Test track for a 1000m
"drag race".  Only one C0 code should be active at once in all
codes you have "active"; apparently the last one processed by
the Game Shark will be the one actually in effect.  That is, use
this code by itself, without any other codes active, or it will
interfere with those other codes.

While you should be able to play most of the game with these codes on,
I wouldn't guarantee it, and it makes most sense to me to activate the
codes, play some drag races, and never save the game with the codes in
effect.  Don't bother saving any replays; they're liable to screw up,
unless you view them with this code in effect.

If your GameShark does not support C0, but does support D0, you can put

D01D587C 6553

(Ie. Does next code only if track name starts "Se")

in front of every other code, *except* the four lines at the bottom,
and then hope for the best.

I.e.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801D589C 23D2 -- sets track to Max Speed Test
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801D589E 74C8 -- sets track, part two
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 301D5945 0002 -- starts you as #3 on grid
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 301D5A15 0001 -- starts AI as #2 on grid
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801FFE7A 0001 -- makes race only 1 lap long
 D01D587C 6553 -- Does next code only if track name starts "Se"
 801FFE7C 0002 -- makes only 2 cars in field (you + 1 AI)
 D00A9CBC 0000 -- when your lap count is zero
 800A9CBC 0001 -- ... sets your lap count to one
 D00AA7FC 0000 -- when 1st AI lap count is zero
 800AA7FC 0001 -- ... sets 1st AI lap count to one (ie start on lap 1)

All the usual cautions with GameShark Codes apply in this case.

Along the way I discovered the lap counter locations for all the
cars in an AI race.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 $A9CBC -- player
 $AA7FC -- AI starting 5th
 $AB33C -- AI starting 4th
 $ABE7C -- AI starting 3rd
 $AC9BC -- AI starting 2nd
 $AD4FC -- AI starting 1st
