I got the Nismo 400R and  TRD3000GT on the weekend 8-)

Well...

On Sunday I went to Zeller's and spotted and bought the Winter'98
Underground JamPack CD.  8-)  (This has a download which gives a GT
game on day 3 with Cr1,9xx,xxx,xx0 credits, all gold licenses, arcade
mode unlocked, and a bunch of rare cars in the garage).

Actually I haven't tried the two license test cars yet, or even bought
them into a game.  Actually, I'm more likely to try them than put them
into my "real" game.  That would give me a funny feeling.

So far I've just made a few strange observations about the cars in
the download garage.

Included in the garage are a Viper with green stripes, a yellow
ConceptCar, and a grey-and-purple Cerbera LM.  Strangely, no delSol LMs.
(Adding to its myth status, I guess).  The Viper says Cr32500 for
memory card trade value.

There's also a pile of race-modded Skylines, and one race-mod from
most of the Japanese manufacturers.  (Subaru is missing).

Remember how early in my diary, I spent a few days finishing up
my Arcade yellow and red dots?  Well, Sunday night I took an Arcade
game from no dots to fully unlocked in about 2.5 hours.  All the
races I raced were at "Difficult" level.  And I never used the Viper.
(It was only available for the last race, Deep Forest, where I used
the Impreza).  I think I lost about ten races, maybe fewer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My suggested strategy for this is:

   1)  Use the Honda Civic for C class
   2)  Use the Mitsubishi Eclipse for B class, except at the High Speed Ring
   3)  Unless otherwise noted, use Corvette'67 for A class
   4)  Do High Speed Ring A, then Clubman A, then Grand Valley A,
         then Trial Mountain A
   5)  Do C class in the same order
   6)  Do B class, but do not try the High Speed Ring

By now you have Deep Forest Racing Way, Special Stage Route 5,
and Grand Valley

   7)  Finish three new C class, in your order of preference
        Probably leave Deep Forest Racing Way till last
   8)  Finish Special Stage R5, with the Eclipse and the Corvette'67

This opens up the Toyotas

   9)  Finish the High Speed Ring B with the Toyota Soarer

This gives you the Autumn Ring.  Autumn Ring, although intrinsically
a difficult track, seems a little easier in arcade mode than Grand
Valley.

  10)  Do the Autumn Ring, with Civic, Eclipse and Mitsubishi GTO

This gives you the Subarus.  (But no pink Cadillac).

  11)  Finish B class at Deep Forest and Grand Valley, with the Eclipse.
       (You can do this earlier, if you prefer).

This leaves only Grand Valley A and Deep Forest A remaining.

  12)  Finish Grand Valley and Deep Forest with the Impreza sedan.
       You might have trouble on the long finishing straight at
       Grand Valley.  So you might want to do Deep Forest first,
       and use the Viper at Grand Valley.
