 :) Can someone please tell me what is the size in bytes of a typical Sony
 :) memory card
 :) which has 15 blocks of memory slots.

It has 1 megabit of memory, which is 128 kilobytes. The card actually is
divided into sixteen blocks, but one block is used to store names/icons
for the other fifteen useable blocks. Therefore, each block has 8K
available to it.
