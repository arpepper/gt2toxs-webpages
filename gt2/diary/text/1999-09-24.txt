I Have a Silly Loss for the First Time in Weeks!!

 Race Results

Well, yes, recently I did lose quite a few races in the GT-I Cup,
when practising with the Chaser LM in preparation for the
Grand Valley 300.

But last night I lost in a silly fashion.

I was practising with a race-maxed MA70 Supra, in the UKvsJP Series,
since I intend to enter it in the GV300 soon.  (I might even try it in
the GT-I, too  8-) ).  Well, I qualified only fourth at Trial
Mountain II, but managed to win.  Not difficult, admittedly.
This car might even be slightly faster than the Chaser LM.

But then I went to SSR5.  I qualified first, and led the whole
race, but, coming out of the last corner I ran wide and plowed
into the end of the pit wall.  Well, there goes first, I thought
as I tried to back out and steer back onto the course.  And,
indeed the FDRX7 went zooming by.

But then...

As I tried to drive out onto the track each of the following cars
managed in turn to hit me in just such a way that they pushed me
back off the track, and I actually finished sixth.  Not very
polite of them.

Thread: Prize Car Patterns

Oh well, I got pole position for each of the three remaining races,
and won them all quite easily, so I came first, even though the
FDRX7 got all the points it could.  (I won 37 to 33).  I won a
black del Sol LM, in contrast to the green Cerbera LM's I'd been
winning before.   It really makes me wonder if you increase your
chances of getting alternate prize cars when you do not win all
races in a series.
