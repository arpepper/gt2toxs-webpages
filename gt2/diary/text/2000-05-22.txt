A short GameShark Code to let you win license test prize cars

I spent a lot of the (long) weekend working out a 2-line GS code to let
crumby players like me <html><em>easily</em></html> get the license
test cars they don't deserve.  8-)

<HTML INDENT>
<b>NTSC 1.0 (offset 0, garage FB8, tested)</b><br>
<br>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
  D01D5028 0000 -- if number of prize cars is zero
  801D5028 0001 ---- set it to one
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>


<HTML INDENT>
<b>NTSC 1.1 (offset 370, garage 328, tested)</b><br>
<br>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
  D01D5398 0000 -- if number of prize cars is zero
  801D5398 0001 ---- set it to one
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

<HTML INDENT>
<b>NTSC 1.2 (offset 5A0, garage 558, tested)</b><br>
<br>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
  D01D55C8 0000 -- if number of prize cars is zero
  801D55C8 0001 ---- set it to one
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

<HTML INDENT>
<b>PAL (offset 5D0, garage 588, not tested)</b><br>
<br>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
  D01D55F8 0000 -- if number of prize cars is zero
  801D55F8 0001 ---- set it to one
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

You see, prize car info (pretty much an entire garage entry) remains in
memory and does not get overwritten if you enter an event with no prize
cars.  Not only this, but the license tests use the info in much the
same way as races, and do, indeed, put the prize cars in the same
place.

So, with this code in effect, if you go do a license test, then go back
and win a Sunday Cup race, then you will be awarded the license car.

Caution.  Do not enter any event which awards no prize before you
enter an event which does.  If you do, you will end up with a
"No Name No Name" in your garage which may lock the game if you
look at it.

The usual cautions when using GameShark codes apply, but it looks
like this area of memory does not get used for anything else, at
least in simulation mode proper.
