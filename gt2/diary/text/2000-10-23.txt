(GT1 Version 1.1)  GameShark Addresses and Codes for Simulation Prize Money

Threads:

 Game Shark Hints

So at <html><a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com/">www.cmgsccc.com</a></html> I
learned how you can change some of the prize money for Gran Turismo 1 Simulation
Mode Events.

I investigated, and found an entire set of tables describing all the
prize  money.

See <html><a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com/psx/grant11.shtml">www.cmgsccc.com/psx/grant11.shtml</a></html> for their versions of these codes.  I use the
<html><b>GameShark Pro</b></html> to do equivalent patches at the first pre-race
screen.

Each set of prize money information occupies 36 ($24) bytes.

Here follows the starting location for the prize money table for each
event.  Following the location are 8 4-byte values representing the
prize money for the event.  The first value is the qualifying prize,
and then 1st through 6th prizes.  Last is the Championship prize, which
is zero in the case of single events.

I have indicated the most useful prize values for each event.
(In fact, it was by decoding the values that I worked out which event
each table was for).

Following doing this work, I discovered another per-event table.
I will give more information about that when I have mapped it, but
it appears to be a list of pointers to the other tables, such as
the track list and prize money.  One of the pointers points to the
list of prize cars, and I was able to change that so that I won
different prizes for different events.  In that same table is
the number of laps for races in the event.  There are two other
word pointers in each entry.  I suspect one determines the field
of AI cars for the event, but haven't proven that, and can't figure
out what the other one might be.

But I was able to set the pointer to the prize-car list for one of the
Spot Races, and actually win a prize car for winning the Spot Race.
Working with only what I have discovered so far, I will have to
restrict the prizes to race prizes, but I might eventually figure out
how to win any car I want.
