I Discover Differences between GT1 versions

As I mentioned last December, I finally managed to get a copy of
<font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> version <b>1.0</b>.  Well,
recently I discovered a way to tell whether your <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
game is version <b>1.0</b> or <b>1.1</b>, and in the process I also solved a
small mystery regarding published <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font>
car and prize-car lists.

It turns out that the names of the <b>Honda</b> prize cars you win in
the <b>FF</b> or <b>Lightweight</b> series differ slightly depending upon
which version of the game you have.

In version <b>1.0</b> there is a prize car awarded in the <b>Lightweight</b>
which shows in your garage as <b>EK CIVIC Type-R</b>, and <b>EK CIVIC</b>
in the bottom right-hand corner when you get in it, and shows as <b>CIVIC
TypeR</b> in race screens.  The same car, if you view the same garage in
version <b>1.1</b> lists in your garage as simply <b>CIVIC (Racer)</b>
and <b>CIVIC</b> when you get in it.  In a race, it shows as <b>CIVIC
TypeR</b>, as in version <b>1.0</b>.

Similarly, in version <b>1.0</b>, there is a prize car awarded in the <b>FF</b>
series which shows in your garage as <b>CR-X EF-8 Si-R</b>, and as
<b>CR-X EF-8</b> when you get in it, although in a race it shows as
<b>CIVIC CRX'91</b>.  In version <b>1.1</b> that same car will show as
<b>CIVIC CR-X '91 Si</b> when viewed in the garage, and as
<b>CIVIC CR-X '91</b> when you get in it, although similar to the other
case, its in-race name of <b>CIVIC CRX'91</b> is unchanged from version <b>1.0</b>.

So, if you have a game save with one or both of those prize cars on it, you can
use that save to tell which of the two versions of <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> version <b>1.0</b>
you have by looking at those cars in your garage.

As I implied, it was previously always a mystery to me why published prize-car
lists would use such a strange-sounding name for these two prize-cars.  I had
thought perhaps the name had been carried-forward unchanged from prize-car
lists written for the original <b>Japanese</b> version of the game, or
something, but, in fact, those two names at least, are how they appeeared
in the original (<b>v1.0</b>) game.

<ul>
<li> easy through first left through tunnel, but no lifting or braking necessary--just try to reduce tire squealing, keeping speed close to 69mph
<li> slow, and brake, but not too much for the first right
<li> enter the second right a little wide, and cut in
  (this is the trickiest corner of the test)
<li> if you're on track for gold, you must lift off the accelerator before the second tunnel
<li> want to exit tunnel lodged in groove, over hash marks, accelerating early, but somewhat gradually
</ul>

In my successful run, I hit the split-time at <b>0:28.635</b>, well below demo of <b>0:28.771</b>.

"Stay in groove, ease on gas early--don't blow it", I thought.

I got in the groove, but felt a slight burble on my exit.

"Oh well", I thought, "That probably blew it, but your speed is okay--keep it nailed, and away from the edge of the road, and it looks like the upshift will come well before the exit of the tunnel."

I saw the "42" on the stopped clock, and then the "Gold medal" appeared, much to my relief.  I was amazed that I had made it by so large a margin.

"Remember to save replay".

Then I checked the demo once before exiting (although, in fact, you can come back later to do that).  It showed I got an early lead by cutting over the apron in the first tunnel.  I lost a little in the first right-hander, but perhaps gained it back in the next.  The split time shows I lost a little in the last corner, and finished just barely ahead of the demo (under 1/10 sec).

Then I saved my game, and went downstairs to get another memory card to make a second copy.  8-)

My recorded times
(I did not save sessions which did not improve my best time...)

ARP2004Jan25 0:42.854 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan11 0:43.014 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan25 0:43.044 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan03 0:43.058 25/01/04
ARP2003Dec21 0:43.156 25/01/04
ARP2004Jan25 0:43.175 25/01/04

(Actually my name is saved as ARP2003Jan25, etc...  Duh!)

Final speed: 118mph, just barely.
I had had better finishes (118 clearly for about a second).
