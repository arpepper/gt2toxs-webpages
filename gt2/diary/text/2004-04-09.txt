(GT1 version 1.1)  Favourite GameShark Code -- Tuned All Civics

Threads:
 Game Shark Hints

<CODES>

My current favourite GameShark Code for <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html> is
one which changes the AI field in the <b>Hard-Tuned Series</b> to always
be all <b>Honda Civics</b>.

Using the address list in <html><a href="2000-11-26.html">November 26, 2000</a></html> I
want to arrange that the pointer to the entrant list for the <b>Hard-Tuned
Series</b> points not to the complete list, but to a list consisting
only of the <b>Honda Civic 3 door</b>.  Since that car occurs last,
the easiest way to accomplish that is to simply change the pointer to
point to the <b>Honda Civic 3 door</b> instead of its normal value which
points to the <b>NSX'93</b>.  </CODES>

That is:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 8008F5C8 0A40 -- bump Tuned entrant list to be Civic only
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

<CODES>
Actually, how that accomplishes this is not all that obvious.  Even to
me as I read it a few months after creating it.  8-)  My previous page
indicates that the table for the event begins at <tt><font face="Courier">8008F5BC</font></tt>.  Now,
the pointer to the list of entrants occurs 3 full words (12 bytes) after
that, or <tt><font face="Courier">8008F5C8</font></tt>.  We
only need to change the low-order 16 bits of the word, which, in the
<b>PlayStation</b> architecture, occur first.

The original value of that full-word pointer location was <tt><font face="Courier">80090A24</font></tt>.

From my previous page...

</CODES>

<HTML INDENT>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0">

<tr><th align="left" colspan="5">

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="4" align="left">80090A24 -></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td>8008C1F8</td><td>&nbsp;"mlnon"&nbsp;</td><td>Lancer Evolution III GSR</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td>8008C140</td><td>&nbsp;"tchvn"&nbsp;</td><td>Chaser 25 Tourer V</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td>8008C3D8</td><td>&nbsp;"hcvnn"&nbsp;</td><td>Civic 3 door</td></tr>
</table>

</HTML>

So, to bump the pointer all the way until it points to the <b>Civic 3
door</b> we need to add 7*4, or 28(decimal, i.e. 1C hex), to its original value of
<tt><font face="Courier">80090A24</font></tt>, giving <tt><font face="Courier">80090A40</font></tt>.

To prevent the code from being in effect during times when it shouldn't
I need a "guard".  The "guard" I happened to use was <tt><font face="Courier">D008C220 6E68</font></tt>.
This is in fact testing for the value <b>"hn"</b> in that location, checking
that the code name of the <b>NSX'93</b>  (<b>"hnsrn"</b>) is at that location,
where it should be during the game mode of "in a race, but not racing".
It turns out that is sufficient to make sure the code comes into effect
only when we want it.
</CODES>

So the complete code is
<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
 D008C220 6E68 -- test for "hn" (indicates "before race" mode)
 8008F5C8 0A40 -- if true, bump Tuned entrant list to be Civic only
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

I really enjoy this code because it lets cars like used <b>Eunos Roadsters</b>
or the <b>del Sol verion S</b> win the <b>Hard-Tuned Series</b>.
It's relatively easy to win, but at least some of the <b>Civic</b>s in
each race are quite aggressive, so the series can be somewhat sporting.

It is cheating, but only somewhat as long as you use only very weak cars
yourself, since concentration is needed to keep competitive.  Myself,
I never save a game after having used this code, but race these races in
"temporary" games only.
