P.S. on the 560bhp Concept Car, with full downforce, and 100mm F, 120mm
R ride height, and 3.5kg/mm springs front and rear, 3F and 1R
stabilizers, I got my time for GVEii time trial down to 1:45.xxx

That's from memory; I've misplaced my notes.  Dampers were 2 or 3.

With full aero, it seemed to need the raised rear to prevent bottoming
out.

I've seen other people say the speed and acceleration penalty for full
aero is not very severe.
