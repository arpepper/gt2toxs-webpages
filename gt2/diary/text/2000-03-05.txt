Brief Memory Map of the Intermediate Simulation Mode Disk I have

Here is a brief memory map of locations I found by inspecting the
simulation mode disk from my "intermediate" copy of Gran Turismo 2.

I bought this from Toys 'R Us in mid-February.

People have observed that most of these locations are merely
shifted by hex 370 from the locations for Gran Turismo 2 "version 1.0",
the original very buggy release.

In turn, there seems to be documentation to suggest that a better
version of Gran Turismo 2, has locations offset by hex 590 from
the original.


This version shows IA only above the Muscle Car Cup on the page
under Special Events.

This version spells "Normal" correctly for the Event Generator.

But...<html><br></html>
This version still shows a Cr5,000 car wash.<html><br></html>
This version still has the garage delete bug (at least when I began
by using a load of an old game, since I didn't want to build up to
eight or nine cars.  I might try that sometime...)

<pre>
801C97A8 - A. day counter (as you see in bottom-left corner),4b,391
801C97B0 - B. total races,4b,435
801C97B4 - C. total wins,4b,371
801C97B8 - D. total "positions" or "rankings",4b,541
801C97BA - E. total races not including abandons(?),4b,433
     D/E does appear to equal "average ranking"
801C97C8 - total prize money,4b,15,985,000
</pre>

Following this appears to be various "nybble maps" probably
representing license status, plus various records, probably
license and maybe Time Trials, ending with the dreaded
Machine Test records, including the most deadly Max Speed
records.

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801CD280 - # of max speed records
801CD284 - 8 max speed records, 20 bytes each
              car(4b),speed*100(4b),name(12b)
         - problem is, sometimes the game thinks there's room for 10  :)

801CD324 - garage count (number of cars)
801CD328 - first car of 100 car garage
</pre>
</HTML>

Soon after the end of the garage is...

<HTML INDENT>
<pre>
801D1338 - number of credits in your bank account
801D133C - zero-origin index of current car in garage
801D133E - last name used for records, e.g.  ARP17Jan00
</pre>
</HTML>

Most, if not all, of these locations are hex 370 greater than the
version 1.0 locations, I believe.

Coming later...  "Current Race" information...
Scanning that area of memory with a Game Shark Pro allows you to
see a "Starting Line-Up" for your race, amongst other things.

Oh yeah, I should try and find the used car lots, too...
