Any previous ones will have been reconstructed from email to Nick.

The night before last I took a "day off" Gran Turismo.  This might be
the first day I've not played at all since I got the game.

Thread: Race Results

Last night I told myself I would just race the Japan-UK series with the
prize Cerbera LM.  I assumed I would win easily, but lost on my first
attempt.  (Came 2nd, actually).

Trial Mountain II was a disaster.  I settled for a distant third(?).
A computer car taking a kamikaze line through the chicane on SSR5
knocked me completely out of control in a race I seemed to be leading
handily, and I took so long recovering I lost.  I recovered to 2nd(?)
on the finishing straight, however.
At least High Speed Ring was an easy victory.
I got pole position on Grand Valley East, but lost the race, having
a lot of problem judging the hairpin after the tunnel, as well as the
fast corner after the main straight.  (I'm still way too slow on that
one at the best of times).  I had trouble with the other hairpin too,
and went to sixth(?) from a reasonable position on my last negotiation
of it.  It seems less easy to outbrake the computer cars now.  More
about that later.
The result was I had 20 points to leading RX7's 30 going into SSR11.
That is, I could not possibly win the series.  Let's see.  20 points
must be 9 + 6 + 4 + 1.  (Confirming earlier statements here...)
(Actually I might have won SSR5, and it might have been 1+9+9+1; I
must start writing this stuff down.  (videotape seems excessive)).
Surprisingly enough, I had a nice clean SSR11.  Starting in sixth, but
not completely outclassed in pole times I just carefully negotiated the
track, finishing first in a near-even 6:00.XXX.  The competitors did
not seem to hassle me too much in the chicane, which was a relief.  I
almost thing the algorithms let you win the race when you're in tha
position in the series, to make sure you still like the game.

I thought I read somewhere that the competitors get more experienced as
the game progresses.  It certainly felt like that in this case.  The
Cerbera LM no longer seemed to outclass the opposition.  On Trial
Mountain I could not easily reel them in on the downhill through the
tunnel.  And coming out the next tunnel after that, on the twisty
section to the tricky sharp left-hander the other cars seemed to be
going a lot faster than they used to.  But it could just be that I was
out of practice.

Addiction.  I wanted to win another car.  I knew the immediate practice
would help me, and I was a little bouyed by my success at SSR11.  So I
tried again.  I got pole position for Trial Mountain, but finished
second.  The first two competitors beat me into the first corner.  I
really was beginning to suspect the game was changing the parameters.
Especially when I also only finished second in SSR5.  (This may have been
the one which was the result of a competitor taking a kamikaze line).
As I start taking more delicate lines through parts of that course, I'm
more susceptible to interference from competitors.  I think.
I won High Speed Ring, and also won Grand Valley East.  I won by
outdragging the RX7 from the final hairpin, but at least I didn't
blow it in the tense situation before that.  And that final lap did
set a new lap record, so I sort of earned my victory.
So I went into SSR11 leading 30 to 25 over the RX7.  2nd place would
guarantee me victory, as would finishing within 4 points of the RX7.
(Though I won't swear no other car had a chance of winning had I come
sixth).

Anyway, I motored steadily, slightly slower than before, finishing
second behind the other Cerbera in the series.  The RX7 came next, I
believe.  As I've seen before, it's almost like the game encourages you
to win.  Even the fact the RX7 got only 25, and not the possible 30
(given my two wins), indicates that the game does not take a lethal
"you must win every race or lose" strategy in these series.  I
consciously drove conservatively, knowing that it was irrelevant
whether the Cerbera won or not as long as I came second.

So that was a fairly positive note.  The only downer was that the car
I won was once again the green Cerbera LM; the third I've won from this
series.  I wish at least I could win a purple one.  For Cr12000 they don't
seem worth selling, so I've still got all three in my garage.  I claim
I will leave one of them unaltered so I can use it for settings
reference.  I also claim that if I win a blue one I will sell one of
the green ones.  But, by all rights, I should have sold this one, so...
Perhaps when tax time rolls around.

Thread: License Test Progress

I was really bad this morning and turned the Gran Turismo Station on
before coming to work.  I did entirely license sessions, so I didn't
need to save them.  (Since I won nothing new).  I got on the board
for B-3 and B-8, but didn't do a silver time on either.  (Actually I
have silver for both, but neither did I beat G.T. Silver today).  Then
I frustrated myself with IA-2 (SSR5 TT with a Viper), and also IA-7
(SSR11 TT with a Griffith).   IA-7 doesn't seem too bad.  You need 2:14
and I managed a 2:23.XXX  But I have to consistently get in a
non-erroneous run (which gives me 2:2X.XXX), *and* then find ten
seconds somewhere.
I managed a 1:32.XXX on SSR5, so on a good run I still need to find
three seconds.  I'm beginning to experiment with beginning my
parabola before braking.  On the B-3 test I'm experimenting with
counter-steering (I think they call it "fainting" in the manual),
so as to rock the car into the main turn.  Also somewhat in B-8.
I also briefly bought a Mazda Special Model and dragged it to a so-so
400m result.  Just to convince myself that you can spend Cr500,000,
test the car, and then reset the game and get the money back.   8-)
Some point soon I should probably make some sort of "reference copy"
of the game.
