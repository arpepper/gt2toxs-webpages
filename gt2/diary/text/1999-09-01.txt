GTO LM grinds to a better finish against an easy Grand Valley 300 field

I managed to win the GT-I Cup with the Mitsubishi GTO LM, though
only barely.  I came 3rd at High Speed Ring, and 4th at DFRW,
giving me only 43 points, the minimum needed to guarantee
victory in the six-race series if you win four races.  The
AI field was relatively strong, so they did trade positions
and points as well, so I actually beat the GTO twinturbo
43 to 36.

So I entered the car in the Grand Valley 300.  Previously, it had
only barely managed a "good" winning time.  It did quite a bit
better this time.

The car was easy to drive, but this time I knew more about making
it go faster, and did have fewer mishaps.

I was disappointed to face such a weak field, but did set a time
which should constitute a win against any field, so I have improved
with this car as well.

I got the lead by the end of lap 1, and kept it.  By lap 20 I had
lapped the three slowest cars, and I had lapped the (slow) field
for the first time by lap 25.  I had a bit of a fight getting past
the Impreza for the second time.  That accounted for the slow lap
time on lap 47.  I finally got by in laps 48 and 49, but the pass
didn't stick when I went in for my pitstop on lap 50.

I finally lapped that car again by lap 53.

After I finished, the Impreza and the Primera jostled for the lead.
(Look at how close their times were).  This was interesting because
their positions in the on-screen listing kept changing.

I had no major disasters, and only a couple of minor ones.

Most laps were 1:35 to 1:38; the lap times seemed to vary more than
with some other cars.

I won Cr300,000, and a black/blue Castrol Supra GT.

This makes this car once again appear to be the second-slowest
Special Model car, although it was 1:20 faster than the NSX-R
LM GT2, and beat its own old time by almost three minutes.
