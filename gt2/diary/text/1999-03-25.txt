Wow, what a concept! (car, that is)

So, a red Viper is good, but last night I gave the Concept Car its
first real test.  I had read about how badly tuned it was, and never
got around to trying, and besides, although light, it sounds
underpowered (in two senses; er, oh.  560hp maybe not, after all; ah
it's a very different "Concept" from the one I will never win and also
the Arcade version).  Anyway, it looks funny, and purple has an
excessive amount of aerodynamic drag, so it had stayed neglected in a
corner of my garage.  Oh yes, and you see the AI Concept Cars trailing
around at the end of the USvs series like sick puppies, so you assume
yours won't do much better...  I hear there is a yellow one to win
too.  Yellow is a faster colour, but yellow cars are prone to
breakage.  Not a problem in Gran Turismo, I suppose (though there was
that time my Barracuda 2 broke during SSR11...)

Well, last night I took it out for its first real test.  I'd been playing
with various stuff in a "non-real" game (i.e. left blank names in some
Machine Test records, etc).  So, sorting out the gearing is pretty trivial.
As a rough approximation, I just cranked the final drive down to a
lower number, about 3.6 I think.  So it's first time trial of GVEii is
almost exactly the same as I ever managed with the Viper GTS-R.  That's
with strange bottoming out or something due to suspension problems.  (I
had cranked the aero full up, though).

Thread: Tuning Advice

So I tweaked a few things, assuming I would get the Jet Jaguar FAQ
today.  I actually did things backwards.  I couldn't see why such
a light car would bottom out, but that was what it looked like.  So
I raised the rear spring rate and reduced the rear stabilizer to
1 (to stop the car pissing on trees) and I think reduced the
dampers, and I jacked the rear end up; I saved the settings so I'll
restore them and perhaps write them down to send to you).  Anyway, with
those changes it went out and became the first car I have driven around
two laps of GEVii in under 1:50, and I felt I couldn't save the record
because of the mess I'd made of others.

So I guess today I'll try some more records.  I'd actually never
noticed it had a full 560bhp, about all you can usefully use.  I wonder
why its wheels don't spin more?

In short, once won, this definitely does seem to be the car to win the
USvs series, and set records in general.


[Now a response to someone who asked me a simple question.  Oops]

I found a fully-tuned, race-modified TVR Cerbera to be good for winning
UKvsJP and UKvsUS.  If you win UKvsJP a couple of times, you will win a
Cerbera LM, similar, a little heavier but more powerful (all-round
better).  Or a fully race-modified Viper can win the USvs series; it's
perhaps a little harder to control.  But that Viper is better than the
prize Viper you win for USvsJP.  Or, yeah, the big Japanese monsters
can win too.  I found a race-modified Supra RZ sufficient; I actually
used the Normal Car prize car; it specs exactly the same as the for
sale one, so should be the same.  If you win the GT Cup you get a
Toyota Chaser LM; nice-looking, but barely enough to win the JPvs
Series.  I.e. I lost with it last weekend, and think if I practised
and was lucky I might win.  It's the theoretical fast way to break
into the International Serieses (which give prize cars which can almost
win the other series; well the Cerbera LM runs away with its two), but
in practice you're better to enter lots of other races, save up cash,
and build yourself a car.

Thread: Brake Balance Controller

You actually need to brake quite a lot in Gran Turismo, no two ways
about it.  I'm not sure how tuning "brake controller" settings will
interact with a digital controller; with analog brakes I always use
14F/12R--I've never really noticed serious braking drift problems)  But
a Cerbera LM with full aero will come off the long straight at Grand
Valley East ii (e.g.  in FR series), and needs only to drop down to 5th
if you line it up right.  (That's assuming reasonable gearing, of
course).  Often you can downshift instead of braking, that will slow
you down, and, if you steer at the same time, provoke drift.

Thread: Used Car Information

I hate the four wheel drive cars because they go where the wheels are
steering.  8-)  I.e. it's difficult to control them with the throttle
since all four wheels get torque.  A fully-tuned '89 Skyline GT-R is
almost unbeatable, though.  In hard-tuned (ie non-racing) mode, I found
that and the GTO pretty much equal.  Well, maybe the Skyline had a
slight advantage.  In racing trim, the Skyline is very close to the the
Cerbera LM.  Be careful at the Nissan dealership, though; not all
Skylines are created equal.  They're not even all 4wd!  And that GTS4
4wd you can get for a bargain price (ie <10000) on a few days can only
be tuned to 333bhp; probably not enough to win the 4WD series, let
alone a JPvs series.  Oh, the way I found best to run the Skyline was
with Turbo Spec 4 but with "normal" intercooler setting, and a
semi-racing exhaust.  I.e. ignore what the game says about the
"intercooler being mandatory for a turbo car".  Not having one
minimizes the "turbo lag" problem, while still giving you over 800
bhp.  Turbo lag in general seemed less noticeable with the Mitsubishi.
To get two-wheel drive advantages, try the race-modified Supra RZ.

Similar to the bargain Skyline, the '92 GTO you can get from Mitsubishi
on day 1 for Cr8860 can only be taken to 381bhp.  To be able to tune
to 930bhp, you must get one which says "Twin Turbo".

The car I currently have under investigation is the tuned Concept Car
prize car, 560bhp and 1329lb(!), which you might eventually win if you
compete enough times in the UKvsUS series.

Probably your next project should be to get a suitable Skyline or GTO
to near max spec, and win the MegaSpeed Challenge a few times to get
some cash.

If you buy a Viper GTS, and do the IA Viper tests, and perhaps some
Viper time trials, you might get good enough to win the "Normal Car"
contest, which gives you lots of cash.  When I did my IA, I did the
Griffiths tests first, then went back and finished the Viper tests.
That minimized the problems with learning two cars.  After doing the
IA, the Normal Car series seems almost easy with a Viper.
