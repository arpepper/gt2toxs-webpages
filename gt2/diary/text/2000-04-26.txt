A GameShark Code to Get all Colours of All License Test Gold Cars

Finally, working with lots of hints and information from other sources,
I combined facets of other people's codes to come up with a useful code
which is, essentially, "my own".   8-)

My code for Gran Turismo 2, version 1.0
Tested with GameShark Pro, version 3.2

If you activate this code, then when you go to the Toyota dealer, New
Cars, page 1, the first seven cars actually available will be the
following seven prize cars.  The names on the page will still be
the regular ones, but you will notice the prices are different.
When you select a car, the prize car will be available for purchase,
and, if the car is available in different colours, the correct choice
of colours will be presented for you.  The only disadvantage is that
you must buy the car for its full "book value".  Therefore I have
included a "lotsa cash" code.   8-)

Notes:
D01C322C D5D8  -  goes before each "8" code
This makes sure the changes take effect only when
you are in the "Toyota New Car Lineup, Page 1".

The money code works such that your cash gets topped
up to about Cr99,000,000 every time you go to the
Toyota New Car Lineup 1.

The easiest way to enter this code is to replicate thirty
lines of

 D01C322C  D5D8

And afterwards go back and change every second line to be the
approriate car body code.

Each pair of values for a car body code can be changed to any car you
want.  I picked the six hard-to-get license test gold cars, plus the
Cerbera LM which seems to be elusive for a lot of people.  A nice
line-up, I think.  8-)
