Each Special Model has a fairly easy to find and follow set of pointers

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   80058B74 -> 80054C58 -> "tsplr" (Toyota)
   80058B7C -> 80054C3C -> "nl33r" (Nissan)
   80058B84 -> 80054C20 -> "hnslr" (Honda/Acura)
   80058B8C -> 80054C04 -> "sipxr" (Subaru)
   80058B94 -> 80054BE8 -> "afn7r" (Mazda)
   80058B9C -> 80054BC8 -> "mgtlr" (Mitsubishi)

With the <b>GS Pro</b>, the easiest way to arrange to
purchase different cars here is to set the string you find at the
destination location to be a different value.  For example, change
"sipxr" at location 80054C04 to "n-00n", and you can go to the Subaru
special model screen and view purchase a Nismo 400R for Cr20,000.  8-)
You can even choose from the correct colours.

When generating boot codes, it is easier to change the value (80054C04)
at 80058B8C to point to an already available car code, since that can be
done with four instructions, and often only two.

Interesting car-buying mode addresses are:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   800540A0 "v-rbr" (Cerbera LM)
   800540A8 "d-phr" (UKvsUs Concept Car)
   800540B0 "d-pgr" (Viper GTS-R)
   800540B8 "sipxr" (Impreza Rally Edition)

   800540C0 "a-a7r" (RX-7 Aspec LM)
   800540C8 "afn7r" (Mazda Special Model)
   800540D0 "h-err" (del Sol LM)
   800540D8 "hnslr" (NSX-R LM GT2)

   800540E0 "m-tor" (FTO LM)
   800540E8 "mgtlr" (GTO LM Special Model)
   800540F0 "n-15r" (Silvia LM)
   800540F8 "nl33r" (GT-R Special Model)

   80054100 "t-plr" (black Castrol Supra GT prize)
   80054108 "t-hvr" (Chaser LM)
   80054110 "tsplr" (white Castrol Supra GT Special Model)

</pre></font></tt>

The above are particularly nice because they have the same top two bytes
as the default values for the special models.  Note that it seems to me
one might prefer to arrange to buy the nice prizes (for Cr20,000) and
win the Special Models.  The nice thing is that if you win a Special
Model, you can sell it for Cr300,000!

I discovered the following interesting strings.  Beccause of their lack
of an "n" on the end they cannot be used directly, but when I patched
the actual string value in to the Subaru Special Model string, I
did confirm the following:

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   80054310 "a-od" (?)
   80054318 "arod" (Mazda '98 Roadster RS)
   80054320 "c-67" (?)
   80054328 "cc67" (Corvette'67)
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

I was able to preview these cars in the Special Model "showroom", but
could not purchase them because the prices are invalid.  (The same
thing happens with the license test prize Concept Car).  I suspect
that if I did manage to buy that Corvette it would have magically
changed into a Toyota Starlet Glanza V by the time I got to my
garage anyway.   8-(


There are strings for the license test cars, but with a different
top two bytes.

<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
    800A95E4 "dcphn"
    800A9872 "n-00n"
    800A9B36 "t-rdn"
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

Note that if you simply make the Concept Car appear as a Special Model,
you cannot purchase it.  I assume this is because its "new" price is
zero.
