Dismal Normal Car Results with a stock Cerbera

Based on mail to Nick.

Thread: Driving Advice

I tried the Normal Car Race with a Cerbera.  Like starting all over
again.  The most annoying thing is how the tires don't squeal.  You
just silently sli-i-i-p off the edge of the road.  It  really
highlights the differences in road surface they emulate.

I tend to rattle on too much.

Some of it borders on rhetorical questions, others I might pore over
later if I ever decide to create some sort of driving advice pages.
("Gran Turismo for the Complete Klutz", or something, maybe?  8-)

That use of the handbrake to force a clutch pop suggestion you "hmm'd"
about works really well, though.  As does upshifting to prevent a
spinout.  But, by the time you've got the car that close to a spin
you've already lost a lot of time--probably too much for any advanced
series.
