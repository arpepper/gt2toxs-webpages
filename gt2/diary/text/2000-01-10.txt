How I Avoid Finding Enduros Boring

Someone expressed the opinion that Enduros are boring, and said that
they could not endure, ahem, racing them.

This led me to wondering what I do to avoid being bored by them, and
I did come to some conclusions.  Perhaps these will help you find
them more interesting.  But on the other hand, perhaps your life
be better off if you continue to find them boring.   8-)

Perhaps I find them interesting just because I'm a boring person
in general.  That's a definite possibility.   8-)

Anyway I must say, most of the new GT2 Enduros are currently a little
boring.  The GT2 cast-of-characters is not well enough defined for
me yet to be able to apply the same analysis to them that I was able
to in GT1.   In GT1, the Grand Valley 300 became my way of finally
analyzing a car, and I ran it 49 times.  See summarized
results <html><a name="back1" href="#table">here</a></html>.
Detailed results are in the following thread.

Thread: Grand Valley 300 Results

The field was fairly consistent.  The best AI car would be
the NSX-R LM GT2, which could manage about 1-41:50, while the
Impreza would only do about 1-43, almost 1-44.  That was the
slowest AI leader I ever saw.  The other major cars were
in between, mostly doing 1-42's.  The cars which were slower
than the Impreza I generally considered "filler".  "Moving
chicanes", perhaps.   8-)  GT2 fields appear to be more varied
than this.

So I had a reasonable idea of what it took to win the Grand Valley
300--namely, a sub 1-42 time.  60 laps for the race, implied lap
times must average below 1:42, with pit stop time included, meaning
times consistently below 1-41 were actually needed.

When I was racing I very fast car, I was not really racing the field
at all, but viewed the race as sort of one very long time trial.

So, anyway, what kept it interesting?

Basically, I would try to do each lap as fast as I could, which was
made tricky by the tire wear.  At the start, or after a pit-stop,
tires were cold, and the car could not be pushed.  The next couple
of laps should be the fastest, and after that times would generally
drop naturally, and then, when trying to push the tire wear to avoid
extra stops, conscious care was sometimes needed to avoid losing
control and thereby losing lots of time.  In general, too, lap times
went up when I got towards the end of the race, as I got tired.

So, watching my lap times was interesting--I had an idea of fast and
slow times for a particular car, and liked seeing myself do well.  I
would have an idea of what lap times I needed to achieve my goal for
the race, which often went beyond winning.  Two things make this even
more interesting in GT2, actually.  First, the best lap is not
preserved between races, so you actually see a reasonable goal time
all the time, since what is shown is your own best lap for this race.
Secondly, the split times help you realize when you are on your way
to a new record, and help confirm what sections you may have done
better or worse than before.  (In fact, I used to observe "split
times" in the GT1 GV300, too.  For what it's worth, I'd usually note
the time after the second hairpin, just before the girder bridge, and
just before entering the final esses.)

Sticking to, or appropriately modifying, my pit strategy occupied my
mind, too.  Typically, I'd do some tests to determine how long the car
could last on its tires, and adjust that number up or down so that
shifts of even lengths could be made.  60 laps is nice, it divides
evenly by many numbers.  Everything up to five stops (that is, every 10
laps) could be done evenly.  With cars where I knew I had reduced the
shift length to make it even, I could employ strategy.  Basically, I
wanted to avoid passing the same cars twice whenever possible, since
passing cars usually cost time.  So, if I were coming up behind some
cars and a scheduled pitstop was a lap or two away, I could pit early
and make the laps up on some other shift.  Or, if I had just passed
some cars and a stop was due, staying out another lap or two might
allow me to get far enough ahead that they would not pass me when I
stopped.  But I had to be careful to remember my tires were wearing, so
I could not push it, but had to be careful to go fast enough to open my
lead.

When passing cars, by-the-way, I used to try and make a game of trying
to do it as elegantly as possible, with no contact.  Since I usually
had much better acceleration than them, the easiest way was to pass
them accelerating out of a corner.  The straight after the second
hairpin was a favourite.  The AI cars never seemed to get the hang of
the final hairpin esses--you need to take the first one tight to allow
a faster exit from the second--so often I would end up with a double
pass there, as an AI car I had recently passed might temporarily pass
me going in, while I'd pass them again at the exit.  Sometimes there'd
even be no contact there.  8-)

I always used soft tires, by-the-way, and pitted just about as soon as
they turned yellow.  For most cars that would give shifts of 10 to
12 laps, but some were better and some were worse.

My Gran Turismo screen is beside our other TV screen, and sometimes
I'd half-watch a program at the same time as doing an Enduro.
It was often "Law and Order", actually.  But, actually, I think
my times were slightly better when I was not.

Synthesizing all this, I seem to be saying that to avoid finding
Enduros boring you must view them as races against yourself and not
against the AI cars.

Once I got really familiar with the cars I could do both by picking
cars which I knew I should be able to drive to a very close win.  Those
can make exciting races, although it's strange how just half-a-second a
lap speed advantage (i.e. about 30 seconds lead at the end) can
translate into reasonable domination of the race if you don't make
major mistakes.  With that margin, for instance, by about your second
pit stop you usually should be able to keep the lead.
