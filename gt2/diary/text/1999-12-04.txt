After getting all golds on my B license, I wanted to get back to racing,
so I started another "100 day" career.

I've called this game <html><a href="logs/hastings">"Hastings"</a></html>,
after the fictional character I imagine is doing the racing.
You can view it, and a day-by-day garage,

Ray Hastings started his Gran Turismo Career by procuring a 1967
Corvette Stingray, Rally red in colour, for Cr8,000, from an unknown
source.

The first thing he did, after getting all his licenses was to sweep the
Normal Series with this beast.
