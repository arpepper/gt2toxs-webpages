I Finally Get a Complete Set of Gold Cups

I think perhaps Jody suggested to me that I try a tuned GTO twinturbo
in the Japanese International series as practice.  Well, that seemed to
do the trick.

I finessed myself a red '95 GTO twinturbo MR. By that I mean I went
back to a day 17 B license card, winning the Sunday Cup with a stock
'93 Civic 3dr Si, and then buying the available red '95 GTO MR, and
saving the game temporarily so I could Memory Card Trade it to my
"real" game.  Red cars are best.

First of all I took that red tuned '95 GTO MR to UKvsJP, won a Cerbera,
but still green, 2nd time won a black del Sol.

Then with the same car, I did a near sweep of USvsJP with same won by
lots (45 to 2nd place 22), and finally won a Viper GTS-R with green, as
opposed to blue, stripes.  Another near sweep of USvsJP, 45 to 27,
won a green FTO LM  8-(

Thread: All-Night II Results

The I entered the race I had been pracising for:

I then tried the USvsJP again, and came third at Trial Mountain (tired,
I guess), but won 40 to 28, and this time I won a black FTO LM!!!
Yet another new prize car!!!

Thread: Tuned Series Results

So then I got brave and tried the Hard-Tuned Car Speed Contest, hoping
to get at least silver this time.

  HSRii    q1st 0:55.671not  1st 4:16.417not  fl(4)0:49.219rec
  GVii     q1st 1:45.213rec  1st 8:28.480rec  fl(3)1:38.950rec
  CR5ii    q1st 0:47.999rec  1st 3:47.069not  fl(4)0:43.428not
  ARii     q1st 1:17.602not  5th 6:23.301not  fl(4)1:14.915not
  SSR11ii  q1st 1:53.502rec  1st 9:13.633rec  fl(2)1:48.764rec
  
  1st 38 to 26 points.

In the Hard-Tuned (aka Abnormal Car) Contest, I swept everything
but the Autumn Ring ii, ie. poles and wins.  Hey, at the Autumn Ring
that @!*@*! two-wheeling Civic nearly beat me!!!!  I had to outdrag it
on the finishing straight.  The two points meant that, due to other
cars exchanging points, I could not lose the series, since I was leading
29 to 20.  (It's difficult in these series to not earn at least one
point in a race) But, nonetheless I won the SSR11ii and won the series
cleanly 38 to 26.  Most races I did with turbo spec 4, and semi-racing
muffler.  It occurred to me halfway through Autumn Ring that I should
have used less turbo there, but later time trials did not back that
up.  Sure, I was able to put in a good time with spec 2(3?), but when I
put spec 4 back I was able to beat it.  So perhaps a good practice
technique is to gradually build up to maximum power.

I won the Toyota Trueno  8-(; white, even  8-(

I then swept the JPvsUK series, but won another black del Sol  8-(

So now I've got all my gold race trophies.  I don't suppose I'll ever
get my gold license tests, though.  I *did* think tuned car series
might be beyond me, but, well...
