(GT1 Version 1.1)  GameShark Addresses and Codes for Arcade Mode

Some time I will probably need to start cataloging all the
body codes, and what addresses they can be found at in which 
game modes.  (By mode I don't just mean Arcade and Simulation;
the contents of memory changes, for example, between when you
are "car-shopping" and when you are racing).

Nonetheless, I will relate a few addresses I experimented with
in Arcade Mode.

I started by searching for car body strings, and then worked backward
to try and find memory locations that pointed to them.

I discovered:
</CODES>


<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   8004DB88 -> 8004B6F4 -> "ccrvn" (Corvette GS)
   8004DB4C -> 8004B75C -> "hcvon" (Civic 3dr)
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>


With the <b>GS Pro</b>, the easiest way to arrange to drive different
cars is to patch the string you find at those locations to be
something different.  You won't see the car as any different, but
when you start your race, you will be driving the car you patched
in.  Be careful about changing the colour--you can end up with very
strange results!

For instance, I tried:


<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   "mlnnn" (Lancer EvoIV GSR)
   "sipxr" (Impreza Rally Edition)
   "tlvon" (Toyota Corolla Levin)
   "n-15r" (Silvia LM)
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

You even see those cars if you save the replays!  Selecting something
like


<HTML INDENT>
<tt><font face="Courier"><pre>
   "dvpgr" ([R]Dodge Viper GTS)
</pre></font></tt>
</HTML>

does not work nicely, however.   You get a sort of gutless Dodge Viper,
as if they add the race-mod, and the extra drag slows it down too much,
or something.

It does not matter what car you patch to select your car.  The class you
compete in is chosen based on the characteristics of the replacement
car you give.  I even verified that you get the appropriate red dot.

Special Models, such as the Impreza Rally Edition, and the Silvia LM
count as A class (but overpower all the competition even more than
the normal Dodge Vipers do!).

The thing I found most fun was driving cars, such as the Lancers,
Alcyones, and Truenos, which regularly appear in the Arcade Mode fields
but which are never made available for you to buy.

(You can also, of course, patch in cars which you have not "unlocked"
yet).
