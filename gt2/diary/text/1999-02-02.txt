I determined the max figures for the Demio A spec prize car  211bhp, 1210lb.

I got:
   12.755 400m
   22.500 1000m
   163mph max speed (using my clockwise running technique)
latter with gears of
                      4.400
                      1.810
                      1.155
                      0.900
                      0.800
                    fd3.200

At one point I overgeared it so badly that shifting to fifth slowed
it down.  8-)

160mph is the practical maximum; you can eek above that with a close
pair of top gears, and run out of power and straight about the same
time.  I could believe someone could coax 165 to 167 out of it.

Anyway, I took this baby to the Sunday Cup.

Autumn Mini
              pole:  1st 43.900 (-2.208)
              race:  1st 1:21.025 (-1.x)  0:40.893 0:40.132

Not sure what drugs I was on for that first lap, wish I could ingest
them for my IA time trials.  I think I stayed on the track all
the time, but, of course, a lot of time was spent on two wheels.
This Demio really wishes to be a motorcycle.


HS Ring
             pole: 1st 1:10.221 (-4.561)
                            (I lost 3 secs not paying attention at start!!!)
             race: 1st 2:04.627 (-5.518) 1:06.710  0:57.917
                            (See I told you I lost 3 seconds)

GVE
             pole: 1st 1:12.288 (-11.128)
             race: 1st 2:16.329 (-9.933)  1:11.252 1:05.077

I used "-S.XXX" to indicate the distance to next competitor, similar
to TT ghost reporting.  Er, no.  Maybe I do have it backwards.
Doesn't matter, I think you know what I mean.

So the Demio went out and won itself another Demio!!!  (Which, of
course, I promptly sold).

For the souped-up Demio, even though it had relatively poor low-speed
torque, the handbrake would not keep the clutch out.  Strange.

The trick works flawlessly with other cars.  They actually won't
go anywhere until you release the handbrake.  But not with the
Demio.  It hops forward against the handbrake, and then comes
close to stalling.

I finally got silver in B-3 license test.  I never fail that test
now unless I make a gross mistake, or a bad experiment.  I can't
reproduce the silver, but when I did it, I braked entirely with tire
action and engine, and I stayed in the middle of the track approaching
the turn so I could turn outwards to rock the car into it.  The action
seems to work.  It's interesting being able to make repeated runs,
try slightly different lines and actions, see times vary, but nearly
always come in under the required bronze 30 seconds.  Staying in the
middle of the track, of course, avoids losing acceleration, as well.

I got 28.466 (silver was 28.500).  I notice the demo did slightly
better at 28,448, but, unlike most demos, that demo is not a gold medal
run.  (Gold is 28.150)

It's interesting to speculate how much of one's improvement relative to
the past is due to learning the PSX interface (I'm not sure when I
switched to my Barracuda 2 controller, for instance), and how much
is due to learning driving techniques.  (And a little comes from
learning somewhat silly nuances of the game).

The Barracuda 2 is nice and adult-sized, and has a noticeable dead
zone in the centre of the analog sticks.  That has advantages and
disadvantages, of course.
