Used car cycles

Thread: Used Car Patterns

It seems that used car stock does only change every 10 days, on the even
10th day, at least judging from a couple of different games I played
last night, and it has nothing to do with whether you have bought any
cars.

Well, actually the first time it changes after only nine days, since
you start at day 1.

Thread: License Test Progress

I finished up an A license at 78 days, which I will keep on another
reference card.  That was a reasonably honest 78 days.  I had trouble
with A-4 (Trial Mountain segment) this time and at about 45 days I was
getting tempted to reset the attempt, but got it a couple of days
later.  I might have practiced it a couple of times last night after
saving the A-3 at 25 days, but I don't think so.

Anyway, wrt used car stock, I compared the stock of my 17 day B license
reference card with the result of 11 days (er, 10 days, actually,
leaving me at day 11) of spot racing a Prelude VTEC (with no real
success; for a FWD car, it sure tends to spin, sort of like my Toyota
Tercel Station Wagon does), and the stock I looked at seemed
identical.  And the stock did not seem to have changed at all prior to
that.  When I imagined it changed after five days, perhaps it was 10
or 11.  And I'm also reasonably sure there never is a Supra MA70 for
< Cr6000.

Total time to get an A license for me seems now to be about 4 hours.
A marked contrast to the first time I got it.

But I sure am sensitive to controller configuration.  When I try a
game from day 1, I usually forget to configure the controls before
starting a license test or spot race.  Wow, major mental confusion.
I have built neural networks directly from the screen image to
certain finger movements, or something.  8-)
