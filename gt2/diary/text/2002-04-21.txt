I Re-open albrnick's Pit Stop pages, which helped start all this

So early in my pages I referred to <b>Nick</b> (or <b>albrnick</b>)
and his web pages which helped me in my early days of
<b><font color="blue">Gran</font> <font color="red">Turismo</font></b>.
Well, eventually those pages disappeared, so I decided to rescue them
from the
<b><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">o</font><font color="black">o</font><font color="blue">g</font><font color="green">l</font><font color="red">e</font></b> cache and tidy them up and present them <a href="../../albrnickgt/">here</a>.
Using information from my pages, I filled in all the missing details, and
even added complete lists of all AI competitors for each simulation event.

I want to make it clear I did not create the <a href="../../albrnickgt/"><b>Gran
Turismo Pit Stop</b></a> myself, but I hope that, by presenting a version
of it <a href="../../albrnickgt/">here</a>, everyone can find it as useful as I did.
