In the <html><a href="logs/hastings">hastings</a></html> game I
decided to use the Cerbera LM to win the All-night I Event, and
did a reasonably fast time, though not a Personal Best.

I led from start to finish again, in a fairly uneventful race.

This was about a minute slower than the Concept Car, but I still lapped
the field three times.

I lapped the first car on lap 7, the second on lap 8, just before
my first pit stop, but lapped the field by lap 11 or 12.

I had lapped them all a second time before my 2nd pit stop, and finally
lapped them all a third time by lap 28.

I won Cr150,000, and the green Silvia LM.   8-)  The green one looks
so much nicer than the red one.   8-)

Once again, for your analytical enjoyment, I here present all 30 lap times...

This gearing has the same range as stock, but is smoothed out a bit.
Actually, the top three gears overlap so closely that it confuses
the automatic shifting algorithm in the game...
