Some Reports on Colour Codes for GT2 cars

Threads:
 Game Shark Hints
 Gran Turismo 2

I had inspiration over the weekend.  I use a <html><b>GS Pro</b></html>
, and am reasonably familiar with the concepts of what it does.
Sometime later maybe I'll expand the information here a bit.   8-)

I found a used car lot (Mazda) with a lot of slots for the day I was
interested in.  I then patched in 32 identical cars (e.g. Lancia
Stratos).  As a check I patched the prices to be 0 to 31.  Then I could
patch the  colour codes in batches of 32, and keep track of what value
they corresponded to.

I discovered that the prize Stratos comes in <html><font color="#FFFF00">yellow</font></html>
, and that the prize Cerbera LM can be not <html><font color="green">green</font></html>
(as was all too common in <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html> ), but can
be <html><font color="blue">blue</font></html>
instead of the apparently now
common <html><font color="burgundy">burgundy</font></html>.
(Interestingly,
in <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font></html>,
<html><font color="burgundy">burgundy</font></html>
and <html><font color="blue">blue</font></html> were the two colour
choices for a race-modded purchased Cerbera).

I did not positively find the second colour combination for the <html><font size="-1" color="green"><B>CASTROL</B></font> <font color="red"><B>SUPRA</B></font> <B>GT</B></html>.
That is, it looks as though
in <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html> it
only comes with red and green trim, not red and blue.  (And not in the black
colour scheme, either).

Colour codes (hex):

Stratos: 62(red--default), 68(yellow), 6B(green), 6F(light blue), 71(dark blue)

Cerbera LM: 62(burgundy--default), 6C(blue)

Viper GTS-R: 6C(green stripes--default), 71(blue stripes)

1971 240Z: 31(Grand Prix White--default), 62(G.P. Red), 63(G.P. Maroon)

This is
with <html><font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1" color="silver">2</font></html> version 1.0     8-)
