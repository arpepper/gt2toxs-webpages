<h4>Ducati World Racing Challenge Is Fun If Not Super Realistic
</h4>
</font>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Unable to resist a bargain, and wanting a bit of variety I bought
<B>Ducati World Racing Challenge</B> for my <B>PlayStation (1)</B> from a <B>Radio
Shack</B>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Although I can find criticism, I can't really say I've been
disappointed with this motorcycle racing game, although I'm sure I
will never "finish" the entire game as I can do easily with the Gran
Turismo series.  (Well, Gran Turismo 2 is a bit boring to finish
completely, but it is easy).  For one thing, <B>Ducati World Racing Challenge</B>
does not indicate to you which races you have and haven't won.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In structure, the game is pretty much a total rip-off of GT. You have
a mode called <B>Quick Race</B> where you unlock tracks and bikes by winning
races, and another mode called <B>Ducati Life</B> which is "simulation mode".
I mean, you even start (on day 1) with exactly 10000 units of money.
There are license tests to pass in order to enter most races (a
strange feature is that you "win" 500 for each test passed).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Money appears to be in short supply, except there is a dirty
trick--almost a cheat you can use. The Ducati Life mode features a <B>Need
For Speed High Stakes</B> type two-player challenge. So with two, or
preferably three memory cards, you can arrange to beat yourself in
those races and thereby get the bike you want for free into your "main
game", to use and/or sell to make upto 75,000 for a vintage superbike.
The game is careful to arrange that it won't give you the bike unless
the loser agrees to having his save changed, but, like most games, you
can make an arbitrary number of saves of the current game, so after
you win you can then overwrite the "losing" game, and presto, you have
an extra bike obtained at no cost.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Of course, it's impossible to properly simulate motorcycle riding
without force-feedback (although the dual-shock rumble feedback for a
wheelie-ing superbike is quite impressive), but the game is good
arcadey fun. My reactions and accuracy are probably too bad to allow
me to win many of the more advanced races, although I do seem to have
only one more track and bike to unlock in Quick Race mode. But there
is a nice variety of easier races in the Ducati Life mode to keep me
going for a little while at least. And, somewhat to my surprise, I
have been learning the tracks (watch out for the trick bumps!) and
developing appropriate reactions which improve my racing results,
so.... (But, really, there are far too many different series, and the
game itself doesn't keep track of what you have even accomplished in
Ducati Life mode, so on top of being difficult, it could be tedious to
complete absolutely everything. I mean I'm still haven't managed to
complete my highest level of license).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
If you haven't gathered already, yes, every bike in the game is a
Ducati. In most races you're racing against machines very similar, if
not identical to, the one you're riding.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Like Gran Turismo many bikes you buy can be upgraded, but, unlike GT
there is no tuning adjustment available pre-race.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The most annoying feature of the game is that you can only keep at
most 5 bikes in each Ducati Life game save!!!! You can buy a 200,000
set of leathers (which is supposed to make you less susceptible to
accidents, but I've been too cheap to try it yet to verify) but you
can't even buy a bigger garage or even just a trailer to keep a few
more bikes in!!! And a lot of the bikes are even harder to find than
in GT. There is no new bike dealership with static stock--instead you
have several different sources of different bikes; Vintage sales,
Modern Bikes, Dealership, Ducati Magazine and Classified Ads.  Vintage
Bikes includes only old bikes, and Modern Bikes only modern, while the
other three "sources" include a mixture.  All the stock and prices are
random; I believe it changes if you reload the same save again. Some
catalogue of all bikes available would be nice--maybe I'll eventually
make one. (I didn't find one on the net yet).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Oh well, you can use the 2 Player Race trick again to maintain
multiple garages to keep handy bikes handy. But, boy, you could go
through a lot of memory cards that way.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I shouldn't disparage the realism too much. Like reviews say, the game
has a physics engine.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
While side-to-side control seems unrealistic (the bikes seem to lack
the proper amount of inertia), the physics engine is quite finicky
about fore-and-aft control; you must get the bike appropriately stable
or you will lose control over bumps in the track. This can be quite
annoying until you figure out what is going on and learn the where all
the tricky bumps are on each track, and how to set up for them.
Having only 4 AI competitors in a race is unrealistic, but actually,
given how obnoxious they are (weaving erratically from side-to-side,
ploughing into you on certain corners, etc), it would be difficult to
put up with many more.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The graphics are second-rate in many ways too; draw-in and pop-up are
evident; difficult to hit an apex sometimes when it shifts as you
approach it. Some of the scenery is very repetitive too, although
there actually aren't very many places where you can't identify what
part of which track you are on.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
But, oh yes. The animation of the crashes is amazing. Not only can the bike
slide out, or roll over either forwards or sideways, the rider can
come off and go flying, rolling or sliding too.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
It's too bad they didn't carry through in their GT homage enough to
allow you to save replays.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
As I say, well worth picking up cheap.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
And, oh well, if nothing else, by buying the game I learned how to spell
<B><em>Ducati</em></B>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
