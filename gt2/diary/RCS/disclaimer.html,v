<p>
The video game titles, "Gran Turismo", "Gran Turismo 2", etc, and their
logos are trade marks of Sony Computer Entertainment Incorporated.
All views are those of the author, who has no connection whatsoever with
Sony Computer Entertainment Incorporated, except as a customer.  Much
information was the author's opinion or musings at the time of writing,
and apparent advice obviously carries no guarantees or warranties.  If you
look closely, you'll notice he contradicts himself occasionally, anyway.

<p>
The author of these pages does, however, reserve all copyright rights
for his own original material contained in them.
</p>
<p>
The author also wishes to point out that any web browser software
which presumes to alter the apparent content of his pages by inserting
apparent hypertext links into those pages does so expressly without
his consent, and, in fact with his utter disapproval and disgust.
<!--
In the author's opinion an entity that creates and distributes browser
software incorporating such behaviour should be prosecuted for
violation of copyright.

</p>
<p>
To produce a separate window that listed keywords and references found on
the page would be acceptable to this author, but incorporating those links
into the body of the page such that they appear to be the work of the
author is not acceptable.
