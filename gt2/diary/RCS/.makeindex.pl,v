Actually, I have now moved the diary pages to a similar, but different,
URL; just change <b>/gt/</b> to <b>/gt2/</b>.
This cryptic text pointer here is intended
to redirect human, but not automated, readers.
Most of the structure of <b>/gt/</b> remains, but not the diary
pages.  There will be no direct hypertext links to the diary pages.

There is a very slim chance that I would actually manage to go to the
effort and expense of having these pages hosted professionally somewhere.
