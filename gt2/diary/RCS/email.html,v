To obtain the email address of the author, look at the URL of his
home page.
Take what comes after the
squiggle, and append an at-sign and the Web server names which appears
between the slashes.

<p>
Or, you can take his yahoo/geocities ID from his www.geocities.com pages,
and then append an at-sign and
<b><em>y</em><em>a</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>.</em><em>c</em><em>a</em></b>  (Note: <em>not</em> <em><b>yahoo.com</b></em>).  He currently checks
that address much less frequently, however.
