Well, it took most of a Saturday, but I finally got gold on
test <b>A-5</b> (<b>Prelude</b> at <b>Grand Valley</b>, going
from after the second hairpin until the exit of the first tunnel).
That was a lot faster progress than the previous test, at least.

In spite of trying to reload when I got too many good times, I did keep
each new personal best.  So my top two times above were done with no
other times between them.  That is 0:30.319 was the closest I got to
passing without passing, and 0:30.189 was my first pass.  It was a lot
faster than my previous best, and somewhat of a surprise.  And, so,
I was able too keep one old good time from over a year ago.  A somewhat
interesting thing is that not only are all my times, as shown, better
than the silver standard of <b>30.700</b>, they are better than the
<b>Replay Theater</b> demo time of <b>30.591</b>.

Perhaps more than any other test this one was based strongly on the
principle of sacrificing speed in the internal turns of the esses
so as to maximize final exit speed.

Since this car is a little less powerful than some of the others,
and the Gran Turismo modeling of front-wheel drive cars doesn't
seem to cause even a realistic amount of wheel-spin, I just pinned
the gas pedal after an initial two or three blips.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I moved only slightly to the right to ease the first corner just a
little; ending up with my left side just over the right side of the
center line.  I studied my replays and began the first turn just as
I shifted up, at about 64mph, without braking, although a little
feathering through the corner was necessary in order to hold the
car in tight without too much speed loss due to tire slippage.
I did go up ever so slightly over the curb on that first corner,
and throughout the run slight, but not excessive, tire squeal could
be heard.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I didn't hold the car in too tight for the exit of the first turn,
so as to be able to smoothly head into the second.  A lot practice was
necessary in order to learn just how to feather the throttle around the
second corner so as to avoid going too fast and coming off, but also
keep up enough speed for a fast time.  I apexed late, but not so late
as to stay on the right side of the road; I smoothly swung out toward
the left on exit, taking a smooth course that took me just to the left
of the center line before I eased back to the right side of the road,
though not quite to the edge, in order to set up for the left-hander
into the tunnel.  Although I entered the second turn at 85mph, my speed
dropped to 80 through the turn, and remained an almost constant 80 going
to the final corner, rising only to 81.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I went into that final left-hander a little deep, lightly dabbing the
brakes before turning a little sharply so as to apex late and get hard
on the gas very early, maximizing my speed down the finishing straight.

So this was a pretty good day.  I actually did two batches of attempts,
since I was forced to power off my <b>PlayStation</b> at one point
to run some errands.  Since I reset when I set enough good but not
record times I used only 17 game days getting this medal--and in the
first session I only used up 4.

So now all that stands between me and the <b>TRD 3000GT</b> is the
dreaded <b>A-4</b> test in the <b>Valley of Death</b> at <b>Trial
Mountain</b>.  Everyone says this is so hard, and, certainly I
seem to be a fairly long way away right now.   My personal best
on that last test is <b>37.748</b>, while the gold standard is
<b>37.400</b> and the demo time is <b>37.594</b>.
