Well, starting from scratch I got the 62 race prize cars in 1167 days,
excluding 15 days "cheated" out of license tests.  (I didn't realize
I'd be as good as I was at passing the license tests, actually).

Now I've discovered how much the "loose chase camera view" option can
mess you up, I guess I'll go back sometime and see how reasonable golds
are on my license tests.  So far, apart from the trivial ones, I've got
gold only on B-7 (for a total of four).

"loose chase camera view" does seem to reduce fatigue, though.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

The last car I got was the red-orange Soarer from the MegaSpeed.
It was a reasonably long holdout in my first game.  The last
Abnormal Series prize-car I got was the yellow Skyline, and that
was the very last car I got in my first game.  But the International
Series prize cars seemed to come out in a very different order.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
It took me three attempts at the two two-prize enduros to get both
cars, too, whereas the first time I was really lucky and got both
pairs in only two attempts each.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I eventually reduced the garage to only one of each colour of each
prize, except I kept two red prize Skylines.  I used 18 purchased cars
(2 of which were nearly identical; I couldn't get afford a red
Civic3dr'93si the day I got my IA license, so I settled for a Tahitian
green one for a while).  So that's a total of 81 cars.  I kept an
instance of each car which won each prize car. But I did, for instance
take the Cerbera which won the first Normal prize, and race-mod it.  So
later I bought another normal Cerbera.  And even raced the Normal
Series some more with it.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
After selling the cars, I ended up with about Cr27,000.000.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In general, it seemed "harder" to get the prize cars this time.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
But it does seem that cars with a good "racing history" have a better
chance of winning new prize cars than those without.  So some days
were taken racing the GT League again and again, hoping to "charm"
the competing cars.
