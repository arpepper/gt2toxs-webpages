Well, last night I finally passed test IA-2.  I thought I would just
practise the license test as something relatively easy to stop.  Once
again, a key to getting better performance seemed to be changing my
shifting pattern to shift up sooner.  Previously I had been shifting
the Viper at almost the red line.  (nearly 7000rpm) But I decided to
try shifting sooner, at about 5500rpm.  I wait a little longer in first
gear because there is a big jump to second, but 2nd,3rd and 4th are
all close together so right at 5500 seemed appropriate.

Anyway, whereas before I had rarely cracked 1:33, almost immediately
after adopting this new shift pattern I put in a

I breathed a sigh of relief since now the objective seemed achievable.
But first, I reset the machine so as to lose all those days wasted with
failed attempts.   <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

Now, I put in some slower times with the new strategy too, but the
standard deviation definitely seemed to be about a lower mean.  A
few slowish laps resulted from trying to go into 4th in the first
corner (through the tunnel).  I finally abandoned that idea.
Every now-and-then, of course, I would loop it at the hairpin
just past Big Ben.  I also gradually learned that one should
brake a little after the first zebra crossing you see on the
straight before the chicane, not immediately at it.  Using the
new shifting points, I got into 3rd gear before the corner onto that
straight, and sometimes, though not always, reached 4th along it.

It was strange, the run didn't seem particularly good.  I seemed to
graze about every wall possible, except for the ones in the tunnel, and
the replay verifies this.  I came out of Big Ben hairpin very wide and
was right up over the rumble strip on my exit.  In fact, I wasn't
watching the clock on the finishing straight because, having verified
that I was lined up to cross the finishing line without corrections, I
had my eyes firmly planted on the tach, waiting to shift if necessary.
I saw the finish, it flashed to the "Pass" screen, and I was assuming
it said "Fail" until I reread it.

It was such a relief that I decided to start a whole new card with all
15 blocks Replays on which to store it.

It's interesting that once again I gain speed by moderating my shifting
algorithm.  In my defence, if you look at the IA-2 Demo, you will see
that it usually seems to go up to the red line before shifting.  I
wonder if perhaps rather than improving engine efficiency, my new
shift pattern improved acceleration by moderating the torque and
thereby reducing wheelspin.  The Demo dropped to first gear twice;
in the sharp left hander after the straight after the tunnel, and
in Big Ben hairpin.  I only hit first gear in the latter place, in
spite of my vastly different line through that corner.  If first gear
would have helped in the other corner, I only realized about it too
late.  But, although first gear improves acceleration, it is easy to
lose it all to wheel spins and slides.

After she found me, she said that playing Gran Tursimo generally puts
me into a very pleasant mood and added that one day she expects to come
out to the living room, and not see me there playing, but expects
instead, as she looks closely at the cars on the screen, to see my face
smiling back through one of the windshields.

She also says I must get rid of all those ugly bronze cups which are
cluttering up the living room.  She says the couple of gold ones are
nice, and the silver ones are also okay, but there are too many of them
too.
