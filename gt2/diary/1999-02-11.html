The principal thing I did last night was make some replacement feet
for my PlayStation.  I cut them out of a tallish cylindrical 500ml
shampoo bottle made of opaque #2 recyclable plastic.  My workmanship
wasn't great; I used a hacksaw, and it was difficult to get a
precise initial purchase and then after you had a start the bottle
was too flexible to easily cut accurately.  A hot knife plus a pair
of sharpish utility scissors might have been better.  They support
the weight alright, but I think the result is somewhat less stable
than the pieces of toilet roll were.

What is needed, actually, is something to make it impossible to pull
the PlayStation forward by tugging on the controller wires.

After making the feet I decided to play Simulation Mode from Day 1
again.  (Not permanently, just as a temporary experiment!)  Initially,
there is an MA70 Supra available for less than Cr7000.  If you snap
that up, you can also afford weight reduction 1, and hard stabilizers
with the initial Cr10000.

For a while I just abandoned race entries to use up one day at a time
so I could check how dealers' used stock varied with the day.  In
particular I was curious about the fact that someone claimed to have
seen a '67 Corvette at the Chevy dealer.  All-in-all, I expect they
were mistaken, though.  People who compile lists of available cars
presumably cycle through all possible combinations with a Game Shark
and would know whether a '67 Corvette could possibly be had in
simulation mode.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Nonetheless, I certainly did observe that in the first few days of the
game the game's claim that you must "check back frequently since dealer
stock varies" is certainly true.  One day when I checked there was not
even a red MA70 to be had.  <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-(">  But it came back a few days later.
<img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  A few days in there is an MA70 for less than Cr6000, so one could
argue you should start doing license tests and check back until that
car appears, buy it and perhaps even add turbo spec 1 (Cr4000) rather
than the other mods.  But for a good player it's not worth buying any
mods to your first car.  You can win the Sunday Cup with a used MA70
"straight out of the box" and quite quickly get enough money to start
real racing.  It seems to me that as your saved game gets more "mature"
(my "real" game is at 1300+ days now), the stock seems to vary less.
[Later I realized my observations here were inaccurate; I'm not
sure what happened to give me the impressions].

On the other hand, this means of user-controlled handicapping is
excellent when users are learning the game.  Initially, every race is a
struggle; it is a relief that you are guaranteed Cr100 every time.  So
being able to buy your way to easy(er) victory by adding parts to give
your car an unfair advantage is a nice playability feature.  It might
even make the game suitable for children.  (Not meaning by that "less
suitable for adults"; I really cannot tell what the intended target age
of the Gran Turismo market was).

But gee, in my replays I still seem to have 2nd place Autumn Ring
Spot Race finish.  At the time it felt like an accomplishment.
The game presents a certain class of user with a lot to learn, but
gives them the means to learn most of it.

Eventually last night I decided to actually try a race instead of
abandoning it.  Then I had a shock, for I had forgotten to reconfigure
my controller.  I decided to see how long it would take me to win with
the default controller configuration.  It took me about four races,
which was certainly a lot fewer races than I had needed when I first
started playing.

This leaves X and circle free, so I have a digital mapping which is
identical but using X for accelerator and circle for brake.  The main
problem with this configuration is that I have a tendency to hit the
handbrake when going for "rear view".
