So, we decided to get Gran Turismo because we thought my nephew
might enjoy it.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  Oh, alright, the sales clerk where I bought
it didn't believe me either.

One thing I find amusing is that if you have multiple instances
of the same car (a Mazda Demio perhaps  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  you can "share"
tune-up parts without purchasing new ones.  You can even have
the parts installed in both cars simultaneously.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Conversely, it's not clear that "one time irreversible" modifications
can be done to a second car after having been done to a first.
(E.g. weight reduction).  It does seem possible to keep a racing
and non-racing version of the same car.  E.g. a pretty raspberry
near-stock Cerbera and a somewhat ugly mostly grey racing modified
one.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

As far as I can tell Demios are a unit of currency within the game.
<img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  The GT League cars almost wait for you to win the series, and this
is a good way of getting about cr25000 + a Demio (worth cr12000 at a
Mazda dealer, cr10000 elsewhere  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)"> I wonder if real-life Demios spend
a lot of their racing time on 3 or even two wheels?  Strange thing is
you don't get significantly more compensation for winning the more
difficult FF and FR series.  (Can't really say yet about the 4W or
lightweight series yet).

It's interesting; simulation mode is like "Test Drive" (is that a dirty
word?) but using the psychological trick of increasing the perceived
value of driving a particular car by making you work a little bit for
it.

I don't think I'd want to start my own GT pages, but might be persuaded
to do some updates to other peoples'.  Or perhaps I should find someone
to do a sort of "trading mirror" with.  I.e. I'd first mirror their
pages, make some modifications, and then offer them back.

I'm really new to this PlayStation thing.  I wonder if there is by any
chance a "download" of some sort that will allow manipulation of Replay
files?  E.g. copying existing replays from one file on one card to a
larger file on another card?
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I've only seen the term "memory card download"--never actually loaded
one and used it, so I can only imagine that they might occasionally be
such utilities that can be loaded and executed.

Oh well.  The RCA video adapter is plugged into my VCR.  I might start
storing a different style of Replay.   <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Basic GT game state is 5 blocks of card memory.  (The blocks of which
a standard card has 15).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
GT car settings data is separate, and seems to be always 2 of those blocks,
and is room for 120 separate car settings.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The Replay data is also another separate memory card file, but requires
you to choose how big to make it.  They refer to the size in sectors,
and I think you get about 60 of those sectors per memory block, and
need something over 20 for the average replay.  Yes, you can copy the
entire Replay file to another card, but you do not seem to be able to
copy one Replay file on top of an existing one on the other card in any
way.  The upshot is that on the particular memory card you are stuck
with your initial choice of file size.  (To add to confusion, the
replay elements within the memory card "file" are also referred to as
"files"; what I'd like to be able to do, you see, is copy individual
replay files from within one replay File and put those replay files
inside another replay File.  I've used "file" there for the "replay
elements", and "File" for the entity the main Memory Card editor sees.)
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

The best thing to do is probably keep all replays on a separate card
and allocate all 15 blocks.  But it makes me nervous switching cards
with the power on, especially since you don't seem to be able to view
contents, etc. of cards from within the game.  (Plus it's just after
Christmas, and it's hard to find more of the things to buy...)

[Aside: It would be really nice to be able to get to and from the main
"Options" menu, e.g. just before starting a race, if, e.g. one track
is better viewed in narrow mode, while others are better in normal or
wide, or especially to set 2 player settings, e.g. laps, handicap,
etc.]

I've seen the term "memory card download" on the "Jampack" CDs that
come with Playstation club subscription and/or are occasionally retailed
real cheap and in fact was thrown in free with the PlayStation I bought.
(I bought mine at Canadian Tire; ever heard of them?  Wal-Mart hadn't
when they conducted phone surveys prior to moving in up here).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I am just speculating that Sony could make extension utilities
available as memory card downloads.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The downloads on the JamPack CD I have are for some other game, and I
think do the usual sleazy free life type stuff.  Ah.  I guess that
would be done by just downloading a file containing a certain game
state.  E.g. they could make a download for GT with B license and
a couple of cars and a couple of cr100K.  (And then there's that Shark
thing I saw referred to at another site; how unsporting...)
But perhaps pre-configured game configurations is the limit of what
they do with downloads.  Providing a means to transfer execution to
within the memory card ROM would open up a whole can of worms which
Sony probably doesn't want to.

   Gran Turismo is the greatest car game that I have ever played on any
   system and I have a Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64 and a PC with a 3dfx
   graphics card!  The Game has an unbelievable amount of options and
   almost endless amount of game play.  Most magazines including
   Australia's own Official Playstation Magazine have rated the game
   10/10. It would have to be the best driving simulator I have ever seen
   and that is why I have dedicated this page to the greatest Playstation
   Game of all time.

   On the left there is a link for some images from the game. The
   playability is so realistic you would think that you're actually in
   the car. Australia's own Peter Brock said that the cars are incredibly
   realistic and they handle like the real thing.

     The clash of modern super cars vs. muscle cars from the past
     continues in the sequel to the best-selling Test Drive 4. Test
     Drive 5 features twice the cars (28) and three times as many tracks
     (18). The addition of new [5]features like split-screen mode,
     branching roads, and breathtaking photo realistic graphics make
     Test Drive 5 the ultimate racing challenge.

Gran Turismo must have at least 28 types of Toyota alone.  But no
Jaguars.  <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-(">  TVR Cerbera is probably a better car, though.  And a '67
Corvette in arcade mode slides really well round medium corners.  Looks
especially good on multi-view replays.
