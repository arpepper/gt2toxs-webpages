Note that, to keep a fairly wide variety of results, and avoid using up
too many game days, I reload my game when I have done too many tries
which get "on the board" without setting a new personal record (silver)
time.

That is 0:37.484 was the closest I got to passing without passing,
and 0:37.344 was my first pass.  So not only was it a clear pass, it
was quite a bit faster than my previous best.

Key to this test seemed to be the first right-hand corner.
My gold replay showed I had taken it a lot faster than in my previous
best silver attempts (which I had also saved; when I didn't seem to be
driving too well, I would watch them to determine where I had lost time
and where I might be able to gain more).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I started with a good warmup as usual, and took a wide smooth arc through
the first left-hander through the tunnel, holding it fairly tight, but
maintaining 74mph; I shifted to third late, after the exit.  On my exit
I didn't go all the way to the outside of the road, but pulled myself
back to prepare for the hard right-hander.  I turned early for that,
after just dabbing the brakes, and barely went below 66mph, using drift
to avoid hitting the inside rocks, and just barely missing the outside.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The next sequence was one I had studied hard about a year ago for IA-6,
which I found to be the hardest IA test.  You don't seem to have time to
go to the right side to set up for the slight left hander, so I just
stay on the left make the slight left turn, but turn in a little early
for the right hander which is a little sharper than it looks.  You must
feather the throttle to avoid too much tire squeal; go too fast, and
tire slippage actually reduces your speed.  My minimum touched in the
corner was 85mph; entry was at just barely 92mph.  (That requires the
good fast exit from the right-hander).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
This took me into the tunnel rather quickly.  I hit 93mph, then began
turning left sharply, appearing to head for the inside wall, but having
drift pull me to the right.  I seemed to need no brakes for that turn;
the action of turning combined with a little fine throttle control slowed
me enough.  I drove right through the yellow hash lines--this is another
place where you must feather slightly to avoid the deadly tire squeal.
The minimum speed touched was 87mph.   I then accelerated as early as
was safe, used all the road on my exit and sped to the finish line.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
A key to all the corners before straights on this test (in fact all
such corners on all tests) is to arrange to mash the gas just a little
early for the exit, so as to maximize your speed on the straight.
To achieve that, you must apex a little late, which means turning just
a bit later (going in a bit deeper) for the corner than a perfectly
symmetrical line would require.  But also on this test you have to
account for a lot of drift which pulls you out from the line you
might otherwise think you would be taking.

So, as I said before, I use a Dual Shock, with analog gas/brake, manual
transmission using R1/R2.  Handbrake is L1, but I never use that.  All
my left hand does is steer with its thumb.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  Or very occasionally
look back with L2.
