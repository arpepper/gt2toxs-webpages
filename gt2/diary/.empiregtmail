   Gran Turismo is the greatest car game that I have ever played on any
   system and I have a Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64 and a PC with a 3dfx
   graphics card!  The Game has an unbelievable amount of options and
   almost endless amount of game play.  Most magazines including
   Australia's own Official Playstation Magazine have rated the game
   10/10. It would have to be the best driving simulator I have ever seen
   and that is why I have dedicated this page to the greatest Playstation
   Game of all time.
   
   On the left there is a link for some images from the game. The
   playability is so realistic you would think that you're actually in
   the car. Australia's own Peter Brock said that the cars are incredibly
   realistic and they handle like the real thing.

     The clash of modern super cars vs. muscle cars from the past
     continues in the sequel to the best-selling Test Drive 4. Test
     Drive 5 features twice the cars (28) and three times as many tracks
     (18). The addition of new [5]features like split-screen mode,
     branching roads, and breathtaking photo realistic graphics make
     Test Drive 5 the ultimate racing challenge.

Gran Turismo must have at least 28 types of Toyota alone.  But no
Jaguars.  8-(  TVR Cerbera is probably a better car, though.  And a '67
Corvette in arcade mode slides really well round medium corners.  Looks
especially good on multi-view replays.

Gran Turismo has about a dozen tracks, and doubles that by providing
races in both directions, and also has License qualification runs.

See http://www.pug.to/gt.html

It says 187 cars.

I saw on CablePulse 24 that Netcom is trying to sell netcom.ca
I'm not sure if or how that might affect subscribers.

Oh yeah.  I figured out last night how you wipe out a game state
accidentally like Boone did.  For some reason you don't have the
cartridge 

I have owned Gran Turismo for a little while, and played it quite a
lot.  I can relatively easily win the JamPack Demo now with all three
cars at easy and normal, and be competitive at difficult.  (Usually
2nd, have won with the Corvette).  The demo sells the game short,
especially since it has too many walls.  Better tracks in the real game
have sand traps you end up in if you corner too fast, where you lose a
lot of time.

There is a lot of stuff there.  It seems to be the number one
PlayStation game for young adult males (like me?).  As evidenced by
its Web Ring.

A certain logic would say that Boone should have one game, and I the
other, and we could trade, but Gran Turismo has lots and lots of stuff
to do and is difficult to give up.  If he had a game, I could give him
a saved game cartridge with a passed B license (I'm still stuck on test
3 of my A class license, unable to get closer than a quarter of second
to the goal time, and then there's International A after that), and a
bunch of "Emulation mode cars"  (including a racing Legacy and a tuned
street Legacy 8-) ) but it's probably good for someone to pass their
own driving tests.  Another alternative is to buy a "Game Shark" and
patch memory to get what one wants.  8-)  (Several web sites feature
Game Shark codes for various games, includig Gran Turismo).

But repeatedly failing the A-3 test keeps teaching me more and more
about low-speed cornering after high-speed straights, for instance.
As well as persuading me that perhaps it's good that I ended up in
my career and never tried to race cars.  8-)  Sort of like occasional
MFCF go-kart expeditions.  8-)  I know enough technique to be
reasonably competitive, but don't have reactions or feel to be
outstanding like RJ White (well, and am now way too heavy for
go-karting  8-(  )  (RJ White DoD #51112, see
http://www.dod.no/dod/superfaq.txt)

Also in the separate Arcade mode I have not got all the simple bonus
items (four more tracks, and four more brands of cars), and a dump of
my game would include that too.  That's probably slightly easier to do
than B class license.  Maybe.  The B class tests teach you techniques
you can use in Arcade mode.  Arcade Mode tracks are the same as some in
simulation mode, but the bumps on a given track are very much
exaggerated in Arcade mode.

And I tried the Test Drive 5 demo again last night, and it really did
seem bad.  Little feedback.  And, while Gran Turismo scenery is not
totally realistic, the Test Drive demo looks like a cartoon in
comparison.  The car did not lose control when logically it should
have done.  And Gran Turismo has race circuits (though only two are
based on real prototypes 8-( ) and, in emulation mode, you can have
arbitrary practice sessions and have qualification runs for grid
position.

And then there are the Gran Turismo tune-up shops.  8-)

"Formula 1" (Psygnosis)
"Andretti Racing" (Electronic Arts)

Chris&I rented PSX games "Formula 1" (original; 1994-1995), and
"Andretti Racing" over the weekend.

Formula 1 is very playable in easy arcade mode (damage off  8-), and I
like the depiction of Monaco.  Murray Walker, OBE's excited commentary
about you hitting the barrier all the time is quite fun too.  Normal
arcade mode was still winnable, and hard seemed very hard the once I
tried it.  I never tried the simulation "Grand Prix" mode.

Chris doesn't like the Formula 1 graphics (compared to Gran Turismo),
but I thought they were adequate.  Some details of perspective and
view were better in Formula 1 than Gran Turismo.  One big problem
in Gran Turismo is that any corner more than 90 degrees does not
look that long until you begin going around it.  You need to look
at the map or learn how the corner acts to compensate.  Formula 1
did not have this problem.  TrU still had some of those old Formula 1
games for $29.95 yesterday.  We might have bought it to share
with you and Boone, but Chris does not like the graphics.  But I
think they're fine.  Perhaps you can check for yourself.  See below.

Andretti Racing was a litle worse.  The stock cars look like
cockroaches.  But one fun thing was that it had a Toronto track
complete with Prince's gates, Coliseum, bridges over the Lakeshore, and
a few other Ex buildings.  We couldn't spot the CN tower, though.
Perspective was quite bad.  As you approached a corner you basically
saw just the wall ahead of you.  Though that is a function of the track
having wall all around.  Some other tracks were a little different.  It
also has video interviews with Mario, Michael and Jeff Andretti.  8-)
Oh yes, it was quite hard to do well on a twisty track, although easy
to do well on the Australian high-banked oval.

I recorded a demo of these two games on the VCR.  Chris might bring you
the tape when she comes.  I recorded Monaco and Montreal from Formula
1; thought you might recognize some Montreal scenery.  From Andretti
I recorded Toronto and the high-banked oval.

Unfortunately, neither of the games recognize dual shocks.  Andretti is
very good as far as controller configuration goes, allows user to map
any button to any function.  Formula 1 restricts you to a choice of 8
pre-configured set ups.  They steer reasonably naturally with the
directional pad, and playing them didn't seem to mess up my feel for
Gran Turismo.  8-)  The steering model is almost like variable ratio.
If you're going full speed down the straight, a lot of directional
presses changes you very little.  But actually, I think directional
response may vary with track position in addition to speed.  I.e.
it knows where the corners are and "helps" you around them.
