Yesterday I got email from someone who congratulated me on these diary
pages, saying they were the most original Gran Turismo pages on the
Web.  Not the most well-organized, of course, but original.

Of course, not only did they find my pages, they bothered to take the
time to follow my directions about how to email me.

Once my wife went shopping with her mother at a market and saw some
black Pansies, and was going to buy them.  Her mother seemed to be
strenuously objecting (in Polish, which I do not understand).
Everything was made even more exciting because two bystanders, who
evidently *did* understand Polish began laughing uproariously.  My wife
eventually explained to me that she had told her mother that these
black Pansies were very rare, to which her mother had responded that
they deserved to be rare.

Somehow I think I must bear that in mind when I contemplate the
originality of my web pages.

Anyway, this correspondent pointed out that the "semi-racing" or
"super-close" gearbox (when you buy it, you choose "semi-racing", but
after that most screens refer to it as "super-close") nearly always
(perhaps always) has one more gear than "racing support" does.

This explains something I thought I remembered where my simulation
Eclipse GT (I believe it was that car) seemed to have six gears until I
"upgraded" it.  Looking through my garage, I could not find an early
car for which I had purchased the "semi-racing" gearbox, (and I'm sure
I didn't purchase one once I began "rolling") but perhaps I did it in a
"non-permanent" game.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

When I did investigate this, it does turn out that the top gear in
"semi-racing" is usually lower than even the "normal" gearbox, so that
could limit top speed.  I also thought that the gears in my race-modded
Cerbera although I had racing-support, were identical to the "normal"
settings.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  In fact, I had run into a "feature" of the game.  If
you remove and reinstall racing-support, you lose all your careful
tweaking.  Now, this is a convenient means to "restore to default",
but it can be annoying.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Luckily, I had done this experimentation with a "non-permanent" game,
and my gears were back to what I had set them to the next time I
played.
