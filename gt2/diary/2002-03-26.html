<h4>I Finish V-Rally 2 Again, With A Little More Finesse
</h4>

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Having finished <b>V-Rally 2</b> by using the <b>Peugeot 405 T16</b>,
I felt I should try and redo it without using such a blatantly cheating
car.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I kept a reasonably complete log this time, so can verify my strategies
and results.  The log was on paper, not computer, so I can't right now
share it directly with you  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  but eventually maybe I will type it in!  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I wanted to use the small cars for the easy levels.  They do seem like
"starter cars" after all.  So I used the <b>Nissan Micra</b> to win
the now amazingly easy <b>Arcade Level 1</b>.  That won me the
<b>Ford Escort</b>.  Using the <b>Peugeot
106</b> for the first-level <b>European Trophy</b>, however, took
me three tries (I did each series straight though, with no reloading).
(Results: 18:22.18(-9), 18:18.41(-13), 17:54.37(+18)).  I won the
<b>FIAT 131 Abarth</b> for that.  In the
first-level <b>European Championship</b>, however the <b>Citroen Saxo</b>
swept it on the first try, winning all eight rallies, by a healthy margin
in most cases--Portugal and Italy being the only ones that were at all
close.   This unlocked the deadly-fast and steady <b>Toyota Celica GT4</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
After that, I attempted to use the prize from each mode to win the
next level of that mode.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Completing <b>Arcade Level 2</b> with the <b>Ford Escort</b> was relatively
easy, although I actually finished only third, by over a minute.  In
<b>Arcade Mode</b>, however, it is only required that you finish the events,
not win them, so that finish still
won me the distinctive-looking <b>Lancia Stratos</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Winning the second-level <b>World Trophy</b> using the <b>FIAT
131 Abarth</b>, however, proved somewhat difficult.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I tried twice and came second and then third, with a nearly identical
29:16.XX each time.  So I tried a few time trials of the trickiest
stages; New Zealand SS04, Italy SS07, Indonesia SS01 and Sweden SS02
and seemed to learn a few things and improve my times on the first two,
but not the last two.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
But I tried again and managed first place, beating my own previous two
times but not the winning times of the cars in the first two times.
But there are a couple of factors in <b>Trophy Mode</b> which might
explain this.  First of all, the AI cars seem to go slightly slower when
behind you; perhaps they have trouble passing.  Also, when you are
close to them you can nudge them into a wipe-out if you are careful
(and you keep your springs on the soft side so you don't flip easily),
and that causes them to lose time.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Winning the <b>World Trophy</b> unlocked the wonderful <b>Audi Quattro</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Using the <b>Celica</b> in the <b>World Championship</b> was very easy.
I did not reload the series, and, although I got off to a mediocre start
with a second-place finish at <b>Sweden SS04</b>, I won the next 7
rallies in succession.  After that, though, I for some reason had a bit
of trouble--finishing 5th, 2nd and 3rd in the last three events.  However,
that was still good enough to win the championship by a healthy margin.
And so I had the <b>Renault 5 Turbo</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Now it was time to do the <b>Expert Mode</b> events.  First I tried the
<b>Audi Quattro</b> in the <b>Expert Trophy</b> and it was a walk-over.
I won all events except Indonesia and Corsica--and those were very
close losses (and I flipped my car in Corsica), and I won by 98 seconds,
winning the peculiar little <b>Renault 8 Gordini</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The <b>Expert Championship</b>, using the <b>Renault 5 Turbo</b>, of
course, was challenging.  It took me two tries and even the second
time was a close, not totally convincing, win; I won 79 to 71 over
a <b>Stratos</b>.  The first time I had lost with 65 points to a
Quattro's 75.  But at least my total time in the second try was faster
than the Quattro's in the first series, so it seemed a reasonably valid
win, unlocking the <b>Alpine Renault A110</b>--which I'm not positive
I'll ever try.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
That left the deadly frustrating <b>Expert Arcade Mode</b>.  First I tried
the <b>Lancia Stratos</b>, consistent with my intended pattern.  I think
I could win with it if I tried; I did get to the last rally, but not with
very many credits in hand (I think you start with three credits, and
earn one extra credit for each rally you win; I won only the first rally,
and appear to have used up four credits, according to my records).  Even
though I did not finish <b>Expert Arcade Mode</b>, I did by racing it
earn the 10,000 performance points necessary to unlock the <b>Peugeot
405 T16</b>; I really wanted to resist using it, however.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Well, I felt I couldn't stand the frustration of driving the <b>Stratos</b>
again, so I tried the <b>Audi Quattro</b> and not only finished, but
finished first.  I won all the rallies except for <b>Sweden</b> (4th) and
<b>Indonesia</b> (2nd).  Prior to Indonesia the only rally I had had
to retry was <b>Sweden</b>, only once, so I entered Indonesia with
8 credits to waste.  I only needed to use up 2 of them. however, and
then I finished the rally, finishing first by 42 seconds with a time
of 32:37.96
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
So I had completed the game, though not minimally.  I had taken 11:02 time
and driven 755 miles, earning 10618 performance points.  My peculiar
driver code was D554A4D03B.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
One challenge I think might be theoretically interesting, but am not sure
I will actually try, is to try and complete all the events <em>without</em>
winning 10,000 points so that you don't unlock the <b>Peugeot 405 T16</b>.
You'd have to drive the <b>Arcade Mode</b> as slowly as you could but still
finish, and try and slow down in the other events and yet still win.  (In
the championships you could wait until you'd won on points and then lose
the rest of the races really slowly).  But I'm getting sort of bored with
this game now, so I'm not sure I'll try that strategy.

One thing I remember someone else saying, I think, and that I've finally
realized for myself, is that in <b>V-Rally 2</b> the cars flip over very easily
if you set the springs too hard.  In general, it seems best to never
put the springs above the initial default mid-way point.  For the very
soft and/or slippery surfaces, it seems very soft springs work well, but
a little harder works better for the hard gravel such as <b>Finland</b>
or <b>England</b>.  But still, in general, never put the springs above
half-way, even on asphalt.  The one little looped road circuit from
<b>Italy</b>, (<b>SS06</b>) however, is very bumpy towards the end.
Strangely, stiffer suspension seems to reduce the tendency to flip
out-of-control when going over those bumps, so you may want to go one
notch above half-way.  Maybe.  All-in-all it seems the handling of a
car over those bumps depends mostly upon the inate characteristics of
the particular car as modeled by the game.  High ride-height does not,
as far as I can tell, increase the tendency to flip as much as stiff
suspension does.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I now present a little prize chart, since the game does not make it
easy to check which prizes were for which events after you have won
them.
