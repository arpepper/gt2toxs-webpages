For the past few weeks I went back to <font size="+1" color="blue">G</font><font size="+1" color="red">T</font><font size="+1">1</font> and
actually managed to get all gold on my IA license tests.  A combination
of extra practice, use of Sony Dual Shock Controllers, and sheer persistence
made this possible, even though I had at one time given this up as impossible.

The above shows how I save my name in license tests records.   It indicates
the date I got gold on each test.  Well, I left IA-1 till last, and first
got gold on September 6, but kept reloading a game with only 7 IA golds,
allowing me to collect all four colours of Nismo 400R.

My wife was watching X-files beside me when I won my first 400R.
The episode where Mulder and Scully are supposed to be going to a
Teamwork Workshop but instead stop off and fight with the ghost of
Ponce de Leon.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

There's just a little scratch on the left rear panel of the Griffith.
Nothing a little touch-up paint won't fix.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  Well, okay, maybe it
will need some gunko, emery cloth and elbow-grease.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

So, the first serious corner I think I went in a little fast, slowing
down below 100mph just before exiting.  A similar situation for the esse;
I went a bit fast through the first corner, and slowed to below 80mph on the
exit of the second.  The the last corner.  Went in fast and gave it
a nice drift up to the top, hitting the wall and bouncing right off,
allowing me to maintain over 100mph through the corner without dragging
along the wall too much.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Of course, the Griffith has reasonable acceleration.  So whereas in
those two B license tests you had to carefully hold yourself in on the
first corner of the esse so as to maximize exit speed from the second
corner, I think with the Griffith the lesser of too evils it to take
the first corner a little too fast and thereby spend less time in the
whole combination.  The same principle may even apply to a single
corner, sort of.

But the first 400R was silver.  <img src="../../bitmaps/sadfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-(">

So I was glad  I did the save thing (I have many many memory cards, in
addition to several multi-page ones) so that I have a record of the
gold medals as well as a game with the prize car and only 7 gold medals
with only IA-1 to go!

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

So, as I said before, I use a Dual Shock, with analog gas/brake, manual
transmission using R1/R2.  Handbrake is L1, but I never use that.  My
left thumb just steers.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

It actually only took me eight successful runs to collect all four
colours of 400R.  In order, I won, silver, silver, silver, red, silver,
yellow, yellow and, finally, gray.  Of course, with each new colour, I
arranged to buy that colour into the 7-silver reference save.
Eventually, I made the game where I had set my best IA-1 time my "main"
game.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The test I found the hardest was IA-6 (Trial Mountain).  I thought I
would never get it right!  But eventually I did.  It was a frustrating
course because you could have a good run and then blow it all on that
last esse-bend.  SSR5 was a surprise!  I'd just done IA-6, and thought
I was warming up for SSR5 (IA-2), when I did a gold run (partly by
benefit of some wall-sliding) even though I'd never managed silver on
that course!  I rushed to save that game.  Later, while trying to beat
IA-1 I began to wonder if I should have instead made IA-2 the one I
left until last.  But eventually I managed to beat IA-1 enough times
to get the four 400R's.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  Only one run was really "clean"; a
well-timed drift into a light tail-end bounce of the wall in that
last corner really does seem to help keep your speed up and your time
down.  I know, I'm a long way from the demo run time, but, hey, my
method worked to win the cars.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
So now, if I go to do the Normal Series with a 400R, I have to decide
whether to use my silver one, my red one, my yellow one, or my gray
one.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">   I usually choose the red one.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
