There was lots of snow on Saturday, so we went to visit my nephew on
Sunday rather than Saturday.

I did a bit of used car inventory cataloging.  There are no really
interesting cars between days 30 and 39.

I went through doing a quick tour of days 260 to 370, wondering if
the mythical '67 Corvette would appear.

On day 270 I found a Toyota '95 Soarer 2.5GT-T with the very interesting
colour name of "dark blue mica phtalocyanine".

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

On day 360 that '92 fiji blue Mitsubishi GTO 4WD is a mere Cr7350.
Of course, a player who has only his initial Cr10000 at that point
is really warped.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

On day 370 there was no black mica Toyota MA70 Supra, so it seems that
there are no cars which are always there, but rather just a few cars
which are nearly always there.

After returning on Sunday night, I tried to compare my ability with the
Sony Dual Shock Controller versus the Barracuda 2.  I tried getting A-1
to silver with the Barracuda 2 first.  That took 9 days.  Then I tried
the Sony, and also took 9 days, and didn't manage quite as good a
time.  But I saved that game anyway.  The implication would be that I
can play slightly better with the Barracuda 2, but the Sony sure does
feel a lot more positive and sensitive.  You can really give a tiny
amount of throttle, with no slop before it takes effect.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

After that I went to Arcade Mode time trials of Trial Mountain, and
found that I could easily better the old times I had recorded, using
the same cars.  I also found, to my mild annoyance, that I could easily
beat the Subaru Impreza with the '67 Corvette.  I haven't tried the
Viper yet.

A recent modification to my ad hoc PlayStation stand consists of two
dowels in front of the PlayStation stuck deep into box on which it
stands, and sticking up about four inches.  This is to prevent it from
sliding forward.  This became necessary when I switched from using a
Barracuda 2 back to using the stock Sony controller.  The Barracuda 2
had about two more feet of controller cord, and so my personal style
would never pull the cord tight enough to actually move the
PlayStation.  With the Sony controller, however, it only has a little
slack from my playing position, and so, when trying to coax that GTO
Twin Turbo around a turn, I sometimes jerk the cord tight...

Perhaps I should get a controller extension cord...
