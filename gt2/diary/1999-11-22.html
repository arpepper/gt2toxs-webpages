I told Tom Servo I'd post a few details to rec.games.video.sony about
using the GameShark Pro to do interesting things with the North
American version of Gran Turismo.  (More specifically the version known
as 1.1, to distinguish it from the version originally released).  I
have not used "cheat codes" for GT 1.1, rather I use the GameShark Pro
memory editor facility to patch certain values during the middle of the
game.

         this is generally a code for the course to be used.
         Many Web sites indicate this is the track for Hi-Res Time Trials,
         but this location appears to be consistently set to the track
	 code for all events.   It can be changed with effect (at
	 appropriate times, usually the "Try Again" screen), for all of
	 Arcade Races, all types of Time Trials, and both types of 2
	 player races, but not for Simulation Mode AI races.
</p><p>
         Values for this location are from $00 to $2D
         $2E to $3C are license tests, and cannot be used, since the
         game gets very confused
         $3D is the Autumn Mini with bizarre lighting conditions!  Some
         day I'll see if it demonstrates dirtiness more clearly than
         other tracks.  ("rogo-test" appears to be this track's name).
         Of particular interest, $26 is the Test Track, which $27 is
         the Max Speed Test, see below).
</p><p>
         There is an area of memory which appears to list all the names
	 of all the tracks, in order, and this suggests the game
	 contains SSR11 and SSR11ii prepared for Arcade Mode, even
	 though those tracks are not part of Arcade Mode.   As you
	 might imagine, a Difficult Arcade Mode race at SSR11 is
	 hectic.

         the number of laps in a race; it can be changed in all events
         during the countdown screen, and sometimes sooner.
         (You can even do a qualifying session of more than 1 lap, but
         that's sort of silly since the total time counts; or you can
         do a very short Grand Valley 300).

          is the corresponding player 2 lap counter
          These can be used in a number of ways.  You can cheat and
          have next to no distance to finish to beat the AI cars.  Or,
          more interestingly, you can set up handicaps of an even
	  number of laps in two-player races.  I find the most elegant
	  way to do this is to set one player's lap counter to -1
	  ($FFFF); this causes that one player to need to do two
	  complete laps before they get to start lap 2.  These counters
	  must be changed during the countdown screen for the race.
</p>
          To set up sort of a drag strip, do the following:
          <ol>
          <li> Run one two-player race normally, so as to get to the "Try Again"
             screen.
          <li> Set location $B63EC to $27, ie the Max Speed Text--this
             is the Test Track, except that the finish line is 1000
             meters beyond the start line
          <li> start the race
          <li> pause the race during the countdown, then go to GameShark
             Memory Editor
          <li> set all three of $B637C, $B68E0 and $B7614 to 1
          <li> return from the GameShark, and unpause the race
          </ol>
<p>
          You are now on lap 1 of a 1 lap race, but the finish line is
          1000 meters away, so you have a 1000 meter drag race.
          Unfortunately, player 1 gets a little over a car-length
          head-start.  You cannot simple set $B637C to 0, since that
          gets interpreted as a "free session".
</p><p>
          For two-player racing, this method of changing the number of
          laps is much more convenient than going back out to the Option
          screen, etc, and you can choose any arbitrary number, ie you
          are not restricted to 1,2,3,5,7,15,20,30 or whatever it is--
          you can race 6 laps, or 11 laps, or whatever you want.

<p>
         It's best not to change this location.  It appears, in some modes
         to be sort of a reminder of the last track used.
</p><p>
         But if you are adventurous, you can change both this location
         and $B63EC, and get rather a strange effect.  The track used
         will not be changed, but the distant scenery and certain lighting
         effects will be those of the new one.
</p><p>
         E.g. race at DFRW, and then before starting the next race set
         both $8F76C and $B63EC to the code for an SSR11 track, and you
         end up racing at DFRW at night, sort of.  But not really.
</p><p>
         *** Do not change this location unless you really know what
          you're doing***
