I have almost totally deconstructed the game.

Yes, I verified that if you allow yourself to sell prize cars, it is
reasonably easy to complete

doing all the races in proper license order without entering any race
twice.

<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

The tricky part is winning the <b>4WD</b> Cup before you've entered the
big-money races.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

But it's not that difficult.

In tests done in the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/fiji">fiji</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/fiji.txt">here</a>) after completion, I found
I could just barely win the series with a roughly Cr50,000 Impreza.
(1994 Impreza Wagon tunes up to the highest power when maxed, and
so is a favourite--it's also one of the cheapest used Subarus available).
(Cr17,500 plus turbo spec 2, soft racing slicks, and hard stabilizers
giving Cr47,800 in total), but, since I ended up with more cash in the
<b>proper</b> game I made the car more than Cr80,000--making it easier
to win this series and also making it better prepared to win the Clubman
and even the GT Cup.  (Principally, I used turbo spec 3 instead of turbo
spec 2; that way I would not need to replace it; I also bought a maxed
muffler as well as a maxed intercooler as well as hard stabilizers).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The <b>Nissan Pulsar '91 GTI-R</b>,
seems like another good possibility for the <b>4WD</b> series
but, although it can be tuned to win the <b>4WD</b> series for about
the same money, it is pretty well maxed then and has little scope
for future racing.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Another thing I did was essentially trade the prize Demio for a used
Mitsubishi FTO GPX.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The latter is only a little more expensive than the Cr12,000 you get
for the Demio, but is more powerful and responds better to tuning money.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
By starting with a powerful FR car, I had a reasonable car ready to win the
<b>FR</b> Series.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Starting with a cheap MA70 Supra, which easily wins the Sunday Cup in
stock form, I managed to get all the poles as well by using weight reduction
stage 1 and a racing flywheel.  A further Cr13,500 modifications (Racing
muffler, Turbo Spec 1 and hard semi-racing tires) allowed it to win the
<b>FR</b> Series.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

In the
<a href="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/arpepper/textview?filename=gt/diary/logs/proper">proper</a> game
(maybe <a href="../logs/proper.txt">here</a>)
I also made extensive use of the
<b>Subaru Impreza WRX-STi version III</b>
(prize from the <b>Normal Series</b>) in this game.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
It's a wonderful little car in tuned and also in race-modified form.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Cars to win the <b>Normal</b> series are key.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The <b>Viper RT/10</b> is a shoe-in, and also relatively cheap.
It's fun to spend more money if you can get it, and use a <b>TVR</b> or
<b>NSX</b>.  Other options are the <b>Supra '95 RZ</b>, or an <b>Impreza</b>
of some sort, but many people, myself needed, will usually need to ensure
the <b>AI</b> <b>NSX</b> is not in the field.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
When you win the <b>Normal</b> Series, you should have about <b>Cr300,000</b>
or more with which to build-up a good car to win the <b>Mega-Speed Cup</b>,
or the <b>International</b> Series (<b>USvsJP</b>, etc) before going on to
the <b>IA</b> level events, for which the only new car you might need
would be one for the <b>Hard-Tuned</b> Series.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In fact, once I've won the <b>Normal</b> Series, I feel like I'm coasting
through the rest of the game, just finishing it up.  This was especially
true in the games where I did not bother finishing in license order.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Sticking to license order, you can run short of money through the
<b>International</b> series, especially if you avoid using prize cars;
in fact to save money I used a tuned <b>Griffith</b> (without race-mod)
for the <b>Mega-Speed</b> Cup as well as the <b>UKvsUS</b> Series,
and later the <b>Hard-Tuned</b> Series and the <b>All-Night I</b>.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
On the other hand, if you use the <b>Chaser LM</b> (<b>GT Cup</b> prize)
for several races, it saves a lot of money.  But once you've mastered this
seemingly awkward beast, it does get boring using it in every game.
