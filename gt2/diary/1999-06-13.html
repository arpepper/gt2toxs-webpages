<h4>Various Thoughts About the Tuned Series, and High-Speed Ring ii

I won Abnormal with a tuned Normal prize Supra RZ, and Normal with a
Cerbera.  Actually won at Deep Forest.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">  (But came 2nd at Autumn
Ring-Mini).

Some people have trouble with High Speed Ring ii, and this gives
them a bad start to the Tuned Car Contest, and they abandon.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Well, you can practise that in the MegaSpeed Cup; concentrate on getting
good lap times, not (just) winning.  (And use a tuned car, not a racing
model...)
</p></font></td></tr></table>

The key to that course is knowing what speed to enter various corners at.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The first one is the trickiest, especially on laps 2 to 5.  You must
slow down early, but not too early, just enough to be able to cleanly
drive through it with a minimum of sliding.  (and a minimum of speed
loss).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The next most important one is the one leading onto the very high speed
section.  With an overpowered car you can gain a lot of speed from the
previous short straight, and can lose a lot of time, or lose control
completely as you enter that corner.  Learn to slow down and drive
around it smoothly to get maximum acceleration into the next section.
In the high-speed section you need to feather a bit on many cars, to
keep off the wall, and need to watch for when you should and shouldn't
be in top gear.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
That leaves the esses after the straight after the first corner.
Slowing to a correct speed for the first one can help a lot, but you
can actually drive those two corners mostly by the seat-of-your-pants,
just being careful to get a nice smooth exit from the second one.
(Remember your B-6 and B-7 tests, and also B-8 and IA-1).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

Try to ignore the AI cars as much as possible; they seem to try and
sucker you into braking too early or (usually) too late, and really
don't drive perfectly.  So, sometimes they might get ahead temporarily,
but rely on your cleaner line to eventually get and stay ahead.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Every car I have won with in that series has won at the High Speed
Ring.  I don't know if the other cars will accommodate a loss there,
or not.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I've never swept the series.  The 2nd place car usually gets 27 points
points, although on Sunday an AI Supra RZ got 30 points to my Supra's
33.  (1st,4th,1st,4th.1st).  I think.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The Viper RT/10 won with 42 of possible 45 points, and with less a
couple of times.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The Cerbera won with only 30 points.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
The Japanese monsters generally won with 38 (sweep, but 5th at Autumn
Ring).  GTO'95MR,GTOtwinturbo,and R32GT-R'89.  But I think they might
have sometimes got like 34, because they are a bit tricky at Grand
Valley as well as the Autumn Ring.
