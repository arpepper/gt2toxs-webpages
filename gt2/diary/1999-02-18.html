If all you do is license tests, the stock only changes every 10 days
right from the start of the game.  Now previously when experimenting
with early games I was sure the stock changed around 5 days.  Perhaps I
was hallucinating, or perhaps if you purchase a car the stock changes
sooner.  Which means in the early game they might play sort of mean
tricks on you.  I thought I saw a Supra MA70 before for &lt;$6000, but it
never appeared in the first 25 days when I played last night.  So
perhaps if you purchase a car, they change the stock, and you end up
thinking "darn I should have waited", whereas really it would not have
helped.

But then again, it is easy to misread a "6" as a "5" on my TV screen, and
that might be what happened.  More experiments some other day.

Last night I created a 17-day B license in about 45 minutes, and went on
on another copy to create a 25-day card which has upto and including A-3.
On my "real" game I improved my A-3 time (twice), using manual this
time, and also got gold on A-7  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">.  I did some racing, but didn't buy
any cars, and the stock seemed to track the schedule I had written down
last night.

I tried the World Cup last night, and got trounced.  Well, I did win
at Grand Valley, progressing nicely from a 6th place qualifying.  I
came fourth in the series, finishing ahead of Slowpoke and Maniac.  On
SSR11 I was mildly in contention until maniac goes flying past me into
the final chicane on the second, I think, lap.  So I don't panic, but
then as I come out of the chicane, there he is across the road in front
of me!!!!  Things went mostly downhill from there on, as I lost more
time than the AI cars did because of that pile-up, though I did manage
to claw my way back from 6th to 5th.

This was in a Racing Cerbera, not the LM.  Not much to choose, but I
think I'll try choosing it another time.  In time trials after that,
although I demolished my Grand Valley I record, the Racing Cerbera
could not beat any of the other records I tried, SSR5 and SSR11, I
think, which were held by the Cerbera LM.

And, of course, I may break down and play their game and choose a
4WD model.
