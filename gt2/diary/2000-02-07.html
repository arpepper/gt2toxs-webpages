I started a new GT2 game, trying to be fair but minimal.
It is difficult though.  Is a Mine's Lancer Evolution V
a Pure Sports Car, or not, for instance?

I started with my previous declarations that you
should be able to buy a gold 1968 Toyota 2000GT before day 10
by using the following scheme:

Start a new game.

days 1-4 get IB license
day 5    - buy red Toyota Supra (turbo)'93, do WR1 and fit turbo spec 1
         - enter Trial Mountain 30

I did this, and was lucky.  The AI field I got on day 5 was headed by a
Ford Focus Ghia 2.0i Zetec, and so it was easy to win.  My time was
almost identical to the time I did in the same car when I lost to a
Lotus Elise by about 10 seconds.  The Cr150,000 was enough to buy the
gold 2000GT, and the Denso Sard Supra could make inroads into other
money-makers and car-getters, such as the SSR5 All-night or the
All-Stars series.  Not to mention the GT500.

day 6    if came > 6th, buy super soft racing tires and whatever else you want
day 6    if came 1st, buy 2000GT for slightly under Cr111,000
day 6    else enter Trial Mountain 30
day 7    if came 1st, buy 2000GT for slightly under Cr111,000
         else modify Supra some more if you need it, but keep about Cr11,000
day 7    - enter Trial Mountain 30
         - by now you should be able to guarantee to come second
day 8    Assuming you came first or second, you should now be able to
         buy the Toyota 2000GT, and might have the Denso Sard Supra as well

I started at 4:25pm, and bought the 2000GT at 10:45pm.  So that's
6:20.  But in that time I'd actually got my IA and S licenses saved on
another card.  S was time-consuming.  I got some of the familiar tracks
in one try, but took 5 for S5, and lost count of S9 (Rome Night).  I
got a kiddie prize after about eight tries, which surprised me because
I had loaded at least one bronze time via "merge records", but I kept
going until I got bronze.  Getting IA and S took from 5:25 to 7:40pm,
ie 2:15, so that makes time to get the 2000GT using this strategy and
having good luck just over 4 hours.  I practice a lot for enduros,
by-the-way.  Oh, and wait for all AI cars to finish.  <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">

And I also had to do mundane things like eat supper during that time as
well.  I must admit 3:05 is a long time for just the one TM30, though.
(Actual race finish time was 52:13.765) So, two hours might get IB and
first TM30 finish.  Depending upon one's preferences one could redo the
TM30 race until one has enough money (before day 9, though), or keep
resetting and restarting until a friendly field shows up.

I discovered some interesting things about "Merge Records" too.
This is still the original Gran Turismo 2.0
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
If you "merge records" into an empty game, you get records recorded for
the license tests, but don't get your licenses or any of the cups.
This has the strange effect that you can get a cup without setting a
top five time.  If your last cup of the set *does* set a a top five
time, then you get the "license acquired" screen, and the opportunity
to save the game.  However, if you get a new cup, without setting a top
five time, you don't get notified of the license acquisition, although,
if you go to your game status, it is there.  And you also don't get the
chance to save the game from within the license test screens.

There is also a silver and a white 2000GT available days 10 to 20.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
There's also a Grand Prix White Datsun 240Z available days 20-29.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>

I've seen three colours of that car: "Grand Prix White", "Grand Prix
Red", and "Grand Prix Maroon".  Hmm.  That last one doesn't sound quite
right.  Sort of like "battleship turquoise" or "army pink".
