Had a go at your codes. Went to Toyota who proved extremely uncooperative
and somehow hid the first 2 cars on the first page from me(!!!!!!!!). Found
the car code for the first car which did absolutely nothing. Gave up in
disgust and went to Nissan who were much more cooperative. Found all eight
slots for the cars. Needless to say it was not straightforward even then.
The order of the cars was as follows:

   1   2
   4   3
   5   6
   8   7

Toyota were in a different order again (the ones I found) although the
addresses I found matched some of the Nissan ones. The addresses at Nissan
were for 1 to 8:

801c32d0
801c331c
801c3368
801c33b4
801c3400
801c344c
801c3498
801c34e4

The money code doesn't need anything special because it doesn't cause any
problems if it is on all the time. Anyway here are the codes  for Nissan:

D01c34e4 4758
801c32d0 d758
D01c34e4 4758
801c32d2 120d

For the Spoon S2000 in slot one. I was interested when testing each of the
eight locations that the 1991 Celica GT-Four RC came in, amongst other
colours, two very similar shades of red. (So what??!!!) Stats were fine by
the way and I had no problem putting some different tyres on a Mine's R32.5
Skyline GT-R.
