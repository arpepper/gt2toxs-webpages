    In this game I wanted to see how well I could do by entering
    as my first race the Trial Mountain 30, using my Cr10,000
    car.  One thing I really wanted to be able to do was buy the
    gold Toyota 2000GT'68 before it disappeared on day 10.

    I started with the day 5 IB license game I saved to a handy
    reference card.

    Note that in that game I "merged records" from gt2-game1 day 381
