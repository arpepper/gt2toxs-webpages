    In this game I'm not going to be fussy about order of entry of events,
    but will attempt to only enter cars which should be allowed to enter
    each event.

    I redid all my licenses, since I'd not played this game for a long time.

    But this time I want to try and keep all the cars needed to win the
    Manufacturer's Events.  That's 90 cars, or pretty close to it.  Since
    I'd also like to keep cars capable of winning all other events, most
    cars I choose for the Manufacturer's Events will need to be able to,
    with alternate modification, win a selection of other events as well.
    I have other garages with prizes, so I will need to be selective in
    which prizes I keep, and almost ruthless in selling most of them.

    In honour of the Initial-D connection to Gran Turismo, I started with
    a 1983 Corolla Levin.  (I discovered, however, that the game is somewhat
    confused about the identity/year of that car).

    One thing I really wanted to be able to do was buy the gold
    Toyota 2000GT'68 before it disappeared on day 10.  A way to do that
    is to win the Trial Mountain 30 in the first few days.
    
    I'm also not going to worry about my winning ratio, and there really
    seems no better way to make Cr10,000 right away than losing the 
    Trial Mountain 30.  That allowed me to modify my cars enough to place
    higher, and eventually win.
