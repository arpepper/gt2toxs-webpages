</ul>

<li><a href="gt3-game1">gt3-game1</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt3-game1">gt3-game1</a> -
My first and, so far, only Gran Turismo 3 game.

Gran Turismo 2 games:
<ul>
<li><a href="gt2-game1">gt2-game1</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-game1">gt2-game1</a> -
My first and main Gran Turismo 2 game.

</li>
<li><a href="gt2-v1.2">gt2-v1.2</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-v1.2">gt2-v1.2</a> -
A moderately lengthy game using my version 1.2 disk
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-v1.2?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-boom">gt2-boom</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-boom">gt2-boom</a> -
A quick GT2 game I did just to demonstrate and document the garage delete
bug.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-boom?simday=">garage</a> when finished.   <img src="../../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" alt="8-)">
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-tm30">gt2-tm30</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-tm30">gt2-tm30</a> -
A second GT2 game I have now finished, based on the strategy of immediately entering
the Trial Mountain 30 with my starter Supra.  I got 98.20% in 237 days.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-tm30?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-race2pr">gt2-race2pr</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-race2pr">gt2-race2pr</a> -
Branching from the first game, this is just a garage to collect as
many racing model prize cars as possible.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-race2pr?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-normpr">gt2-normpr</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-normpr">gt2-normpr</a> -
This is similar, but for collecting normal prizes.
Given the number of prizes
in GT2, I may need to create yet another one for normal prizes.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-normpr?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-histcar">gt2-histcar</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-histcar">gt2-histcar</a> -
And this is for collecting historical used cars, such as the 1968 Toyota
2000GT.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-histcar?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-racepr">gt2-racepr</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-racepr">gt2-racepr</a> -
This was the game previously used to collect racing models, and
has now been frozen.  (In fact, the save has probably been deleted by now).
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-racepr?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-day5ib">gt2-day5ib</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-day5ib">gt2-day5ib</a> -
This is merely the first four GT2 licenses in four days, ending at day 5.
Since I bought no cars up till
then, this is a very boring garage...
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt2-day5ib?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="gt2-day7s">gt2-day7s</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt2-day7s">gt2-day7s</a> -
This is merely all six GT2 licenses in six days, ending at day 7.
Since I bought no cars up till then, this is a very boring garage...

The following are somewhat detailed text file logs I have kept for several 
Gran Turismo 1 games:
<ul>
<li><a href="main">main</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=main">main</a> -
A pseudo-log of my main game.  I got tired of not knowing what I had done,
so faked this log--real records begin on day 5446!
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=main?simday=">garage</a> right now.
</li>
<li><a href="blue">blue</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=blue">blue</a> -
I got all race prize cars in 1167 game days.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=blue?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="allstars">allstars</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=allstars">allstars</a> -
Branching off from my main game, I began collecting the stars from various
"fast" games I had done.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=allstars?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="silver">silver</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=silver">silver</a> -
I got all race trophies reasonably quickly, in 132 game days.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=silver?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="gold">gold</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gold">gold</a> -
I got all race trophies in the minimum possible time of 100 game days,
ending on day 101.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gold?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="platinum">platinum</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=platinum">platinum</a> -
Branching from the gold game,
I try for all race trophies in the minimum possible time of 100 game days,
ending on day 101, but buying even fewer cars.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=platinum?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="hastings">hastings</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=hastings">hastings</a> -
The legend of Ray Hastings, who used a 1967 Corvette Stingray as his
starter car.
With luck, no other cars need be bought, but if one is unlucky, no 4wd
will be won, necessitating a purchase.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=hastings?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="nismo">nismo</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=nismo">nismo</a> -
I use a Nissan Nismo 400R as a starter car.  You get this for all
golds on your IA license (but I didn't...).  In spite of getting Gran
Turismo 2, I have gone back and finished this game.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=nismo?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="fairlady">fairlady</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=fairlady">fairlady</a> -
I use the Nissan Fairlady Z Type S Twin Turbo 2 Seater as much as possible
in this minimal (100 day) game.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=fairlady?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="fiji">fiji</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=fiji">fiji</a> -
I started with the 4WD Fiji Blue Mitsubishi GTO'92 in this minimal
(100 day) game.  Admitting that I am not a great player, I planned on buying
a Normal car entry.  Using careful strategy I was able to buy a Griffith; more
expensive than the Viper RT/10--the cheapest car capable of dominating the
Normal Series.  I cloned the prize Camaro as an entry for the <b>UKvsUS</b>
Series, but in theory I could have modified the single car and still kept
it technically eligible for the <b>FR</b> Series.  After completing
this game, I played a few more days of it experimenting for the 
<a href="proper">proper</a> game I later did.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=fiji?simday=">garage</a> when done.
</li>
<li><a href="lancer">lancer</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=lancer">lancer</a> -
I got three Lancer Evolution IV GSR's from the 4WD seriers, and used them
as much as possible.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=lancer?simday=">garage</a> when done.
</li>
<li><a href="proper">proper</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=proper">proper</a> -
I finished this minimal (100 day) game in license-test order,
selling prize cars.  I also used Nissans as much as possible.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=proper?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="nissan">nissan</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=nissan">nissan</a> -
I finished this minimal (100 day) game in license-test order.
<li><a href="supra">supra</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=supra">supra</a> -
I use the 1995 Toyota Supra RZ as much as possible in this
minimal (100 day) game.  In fact, I used Toyota for all races,
except for the UKvsUS series.
After that I went on to try out various other cars, experimenting with
possible strategies, as well as just having fun.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=supra?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-24hour">gt1-24hour</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt1-24hour">gt1-24hour</a> -
I tried to do this game quickly, in terms of real time.
It is not a minimal game for several reasons.
I tried to finish in one 24-hour period, but did not quite manage that.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt1-24hour?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-mazda">gt1-mazda</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt1-mazda">gt1-mazda</a> -
I started this as a minimal (100 day) game.
I used Mazdas as much as possible.
After completing it, I continued to collect all the cheapest used
cars available.
After making checkpoint saves, I race-modified the cheapest instance
of each used car, and tried every one of them out in at least
one of the <b>GTI</b> (World Cup), <b>USvsJP</b>, <b>UKvsJP</b> or <b>GT
Cup</b> series.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt1-mazda?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-tuned">gt1-tuned</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt1-tuned">gt1-tuned</a> -
In this offshoot of the <b>gt1-mazda</b> game, I began entering every
model of used car in the <b>Hard-Tuned Series</b>.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt1-tuned?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-2014">gt1-2014</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt1-2014">gt1-2014</a> -
In 2014 I decided to start over again; a brand-new game.
Sort of a 15th Anniversary celebration.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt1-2014?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="gt1-2019">gt1-2019</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=gt1-2019">gt1-2019</a> -
In 2019, on the Victoria Day weekend, I decided to start over again; a brand-new game.  I'd just received some new (refurbished) PS1 memory cards from Australia.  Being right-hand drive, these memory cards take some getting used to.
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=gt1-2019?simday=">garage</a> so far.
</li>
<li><a href="starter">starter</a> <a href="textview.cgi?filename=starter">starter</a> -
This is merely all three licenses, ending at day 25.  By resetting the
game on failed attempts, of course.  Since I bought no cars up till
then, this is a very boring garage...
That <a href="garage.cgi?garage=starter?simday=">garage</a> when finished.
