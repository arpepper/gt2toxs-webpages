1) Balance Springs and Dampers

  Last night I was tuning up a Griffith 500 (no race-mod).

  At one point it got the "Demio dance" phenomenon, where a slight bump
  lifts the inside wheels way off the ground, and it reverberates a
  couple of times.  Previously, I have fixed this by softening the
  dampers.  Now, that does work, but it makes the car sort of "wobbly",
  and now I'm getting better at the "Hard-Tuned Car Speed Contest"
  (which I call the "Abnormal Series", for short), I'm getting more
  demanding about the handling of my cars.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

  So I tried something else.  I put the dampers back to their default
  setting (4), and *raised* the spring rate all round.  Just two
  notches (.2).  And the phenomenon went almost totally away.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
  All I can figure is that GT sort of counts "dampers" as a force to
  cancel out the rebound of a spring, but, especially with light cars,
  allows excess damping to generate a force which severely lifts the
  inside wheels.  This is partly as a consequence of deliberately
  exaggerating effects to provide visible feedback.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
  Anyway, the upshot is that balancing springs and dampers seems more
  important than one would expect, and that, while the lifting off the
  road does seem reasonable as a visual exaggeration of the effect of
  overly-stiff suspension, the suspension isn't necessarily overly
  stiff, but may be just overly damped for the spring force being
  used.  *And* (restating again) that problem can be fixed by either
  increasing the spring force, or reducing the dampers, with different
  side-effects for each solution.  Further more, you can "stiffen up"
  suspension, but still control bounce if you keep the dampers properly
  balanced with the springs.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

  (One should also note how slight the spring rate change was, and what
  a big difference it made).  This was with stabilizers no less than
  3/3, and perhaps 4/4 or 5F/4R  (though the TVR's have fairly natural
  understeer, unless provoked by brake or throttle).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
I should experiment with very high spring rates and low dampers, to see
what that looks like.  I would not be surprised if a similar (but
slightly different) oscillating bouncing set in in that state, too.
In which case, you need to guess which way out of balance your springs
and dampers are in order to be able to adjust one or the other
appropriately.

2) Different Stabilizers Easy Way to Setup for Different Course
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
  As far as stabilizers go, I am finding that it helps a lot at Autumn
  Ring ii to use 3/3 stabilizers on cars where I usually use more on
  most tracks.  The speed is slower there, so oscillations under
  braking and cornering are easier to control, and the lower
  stabilizers lets you drive around the corners rather than sliding.
  The body roll is even useful for judging your cornering limits, and,
  when the body rolls without the tires, the inside tires keep more
  cornering force.  (Until such a time that the weight transfer is
  significant enough to start secondary effects).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="15%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
  With real light-weight cars such as Demios, Glanzas and Civics, I
  tend to run with no stabilizers; the tracks in the FF and Lwt series
  tend to suit agile rather than stable setups, and the 0 stabilizer
  setting seems to keep all four wheels on the ground, too.  Probably,
  springs, stabilizers and dampers all need to be balanced, although
  you seem on most cars to be able to get away with tweaking just
  stabilizers to get desired effect without too many side-effects.
  Well, I guess I imply that's true except for those very lightweight
  FF cars.
