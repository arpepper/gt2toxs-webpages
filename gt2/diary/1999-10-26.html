<h4>Playing and logging some alternate "fast" games
</h4>
</font>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
In the directory <a href="logs">logs</a> I keep several text file
which are detailed logs of various games.  <a href="logs/blue">
logs/blue</a> is a game in which, perhaps foolishly, I collected
all the race prize cars as quickly as I was able to.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
For the last several days I played a game of Gran Turismo in which
I honestly collected all the gold race cups in 132 simulation days.
The only event I entered twice was the Sunday Cup.  I have a text
file which is a detailed log of it in <a href="logs/silver">logs/silver</a>.
The results of
that game led me to thinking that it must be possible to win all
the gold race cups without entering any event twice.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
So I am now embarking on a strategy, the detailed results of which
will be kept in <a href="logs/gold">logs/gold</a>, to legitimately
create a game card of day 101 with all the gold race cups acquired.
This requires me to pass all my license tests in one try, and enter
no event more than once.  Needless to say, it is necessary to
make use of the "reload" feature to accomplish this.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
However, leaving aside arranging to pass license tests in one day,
this task is otherwise fairly do-able for me.  By reloading the
game, I got my A license by day 17, and then began racing.  Between
days 10 and 19 I purchase the captiva blue pearl Civic 3dr'93si for
Cr8,870.  As with most cars, I can easily win the Sunday Cup with
this.  In fact, I would advise reloading the game if you do not get the
pole for the Autumn Ring Mini.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
After sweeping the Sunday Cup with one pole, you can use most of the
money to tune the Civic as detailed in the log.  Using semi-racing
tires is a good way to save money.  You can then enter the FF or
Clubman Series as you prefer, and win that (the Lightweight tends to be
a little harder, and should be saved for later).  After winning one of
those, tune the Civic some more, being careful to keep enough so that
after finishing these four series you have the Cr68,800 necessary to
purchase a Viper RT/10.  You can also consider selling the initial
Civic, and/or some of your prize cars, but you shouldn't have to and
it won't make much difference.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
After getting the Viper RT/10, you win the Normal Series--that should
be on day 39.  Day 39 is the last day for a while that a GTO'95MR
is available, so snap one up and max-tune (weight reduction, but no
racing modification) it with all the Normal Series winnings.  This is
probably the last car you need to buy.  So now you can get your IA
license in 8 days, or go racing, as you prefer.  The GTO'95MR can make
mince-meat of the GT Cup, and the 4wd series, but it is probably also
the best bet to win the All-Night I.  The GTO'95MR is also better for
winning the vsJP series than the other alternative--the Chaser LM.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
But my strategy for winning the vsJP series would be first get the
IA license and then win the All-night I (yes, I) with the tuned
GTO'95MR.  It can be done fairly easily.  Then, take the nice Silvia
LM you win for that and win the Grand Valley 300.  I find that Silvia
one of the most pleasant cars to drive in that race; it is easy on
tires and does not suffer too much when its tires do get worn.  That
gets you a pile of money (which you don't really need) and Castrol
Supra GT to win the vsJP Series with, although you need to be careful
to keep it pointing in the right direction.  So, as I said, you might
prefer to just use the tuned GTO'95MR to win those two Series.
Hopefully you win either a Viper or a Cerbera with which to win the
UKvsUS Series.  If not, you have enough money to buy and tune any
of the Vipers or TVRs.  Depending upon your preferences, you could
race-modify the Viper you used for the Normal, but I prefer to
keep a car capable of winning each series.  The GTO'95MR can clean up
the Mega, the All-nightII, and the Tuned Series, and your favourite of
the LM prize cars you win can win the the GT-I Cup.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Sometime you should win the FR series with the Viper (it can be easily
done stock)--if you do it before the Normal Series, however, you might
not be able to get a GTO'95MR.  (But with a probable Cr25,000 to
Cr29,500 for the FR series, plus the change you probably have,
you will probably get the approximately Cr29,000 from it, so it might
be worth the risk).
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
An alternate strategy would be to use the Normal Series prize in place
of the GTO'95MR.  The Supra should be able to win all the same events
as the GTO, but is not eligible for the 4wd event, which then becomes
problematic.  (The FTO LM, if won, could enter, but some would consider
that cheating).  The Impreza can easily win the 4wd event, but I'm not
sure how it would do at the All-nightI or even the Tuned Series.
</p></font></td></tr></table>
<table width="85%"><tr><td width="10%"></td>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>
Another alternate strategy would involve trying a Corvette (the
cheaper one) in the Normal Series instead of a Viper.  I'm not sure
how that would work out.  Before trying a game like that, I first
have to try out the Corvette in the Normal Series.   <img src="../../bitmaps/happyfrog.gif" width="30" height="18" border="0" alt="8-)">
