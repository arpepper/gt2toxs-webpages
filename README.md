# gt2toxs-webpages
Web pages, originally created for my geocities userid gt2toxs.  The tar file should end up as a file hierarchy which, if the top-level is removed, would work under apache (modulo .htaccess permissions of the server).  I resolved that top-level could go right under public_html, but alternatively in a sub-directory several levels below.  Therefore a top-level "public_html" is not part of the hierarchy here.

This is my second attempt with an identical repository name, because my first attempt included many gifs which were unnecessary and mildly inappropriate.  I completed deleted the first attempt, to try to make sure no artifacts of those remained.
